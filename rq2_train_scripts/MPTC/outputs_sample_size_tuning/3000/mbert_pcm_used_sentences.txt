We no doubt am say Western economy still dey depend on developing kontri dem
As Africa economy be dey sweet kontri dem wey don develop
If Africa fir process dia natural resources , plenty business wey dey develop kontri dem fit fail
Many business wey dey United States and United Kingdom dey fail as China dey bikom world manufacturing hub
E also dey di enterest of West economy dem make Africa rely on import and e be safe haven for moni wey dem dey still inside Africa
Diz don be di arguments of Kwame Nkrumah , Sekou Toure , Amilcar Cabral , Walter Rodney , and many odas dem
Di argument dey relevant today as dem be for 1950s and 1960s

God create us make we dey worship am
and you suppose dey protect my rights as muslim for any document dem wey you go dey bring and e go get two ways to do am

And na how we go live in peace be dat , he tok
All of una know say before 1914 , Nigeria no dey , but Sokoto Caliphate , Kanem Borno Empire , Oyo Empire and Benin Kingdom dey

Make we add to diz , di million ton of grass wey dey fallow land and open range
To access diz fodder dem , wey dey always dey available only for situ , cattle go move and dem go dey openly gaze
for many case , dem go pay farmer and take permission before dem do am
Na diz touchlight why kilo of beef dey sell for N1700
Until di kontri get ways wey dem fit process di fodder dem , banning open grazing no fit apun
But I know say some wayo pipo wey dey among herder dem dey engage for criminal things and justice system no see dem prosecute
Na small scale livestock producer dem wey settle for different different community wey dey Nigeria
Dem go negotiate wit pipo wey get di community t buy land wey dem go build , grow dia crop and keep dia cattle
She tok say di center don agree and stand gidigba for INEC for di review and realignment of some of im department make im dey very very capable to fit produce result and efficient for di management of im human resources and assets .
dem don add 6 NIPP plant dem , 22 new substation for di power grid wey dey 6 years report .
Generation companies ( GenCos ) and 22 power substation wey dem build and dey operate between 2015 and now , don make improvement dey for di national eletcricity grid to di 5 , 800 megourtt wey be di highest peak energy wey dem record for March 2021 .
Dis dey according to di latest NIPP report on top power project execution since 2015 , wey Daily trust obtained from di Niger Delta power holding company ( NDPHC ) .
Di NIPP na di intervention vehicle warehouse wey di federal , state and local goment own for NDPHC .
For 2015 , di power grid don dey between 4 , 500 megourtts ( MW ) wey don bikom useful by di commissioning and utilisation of Geregu , Omotosho , Olorunshogo , Alaoji , calabar , Ihovbor NIPP GesCos
Dat one add nearly 1 , 000MW
Howeva , di grid continue to dey rise wit all - time peak electricity wey don reach 5 , 801 . 60MW as of March 2021 , according to di statistics wey we get from independent system operation ( ISO ) arm of di Transmission company of Nigeria .
( TCN )
NDPHC don start di NIPP intervention wit di first phase wey dey power generation .
E don begin dey build 10 power GenCos wey dem dey call ' The Big Ten' around gas - producing state dem wey include Ondo , Ogun , and Kogi states .
Howeva , work still dey go on dem till 2015
Dem lunch the second phase for 2015 to include intervention project , wey go focus on transmission , distribution , and energy wey dem don renew towards meeting NDPHC mandate for lighting di nation .
currently , dem bin dey six power GenCos wey dey produce about 3 , 400MW electricity for di national grid while di four oda GenCos dey ongoing .
Even among di four , some of im turbines don dey commission and dey operational since 2015 .
Explanation of di report show say di NIPP intervention for di transmission section wey dey di power sector value di chain , NDPHC don complete 22 substations wey bin dey compromise 10 units of 330 / 132 kilovolts ( KV ) level and 12 units of 132 / 33KV substations .
E don also complete 2 , 194 kilometres wey dey 330KV power transmission line and 887km wey dey 132KV transmission lines .
Dis infracstructure since 2015 , don add 5 , 590MVA energy supply capacity wey dey 330KV level and 3 , 793MVA wey dey 132KV level .
To promote energy wey dey clean and improve , di NIPP for di second phase don turn to major driver of di federal goment energy mix by 2030 wey dem dey call vision 30 - 30 - 30 wich seek energy wey go improve to at least 30 percent of di energy grid by 2030 .
While e don install 20 , 000 solar home systems for some northen states , di NIPP don dey deliver a huge part of the ongoing five million SHS to domot nationwide under di Economic Sustainability plan ( ESP ) .
Dia bin dey intervention for di gas sector wey go solve major challenge of di power plant wich be di availability of gas - to - power .
According to di oga patapata for NDPHC , Mr Chiedu Ugbo , for interview wey im get with Daily Trust , di company dey achieve dis tru di fuel and gas or public private partnership model .
E don create a department for dis to spearhead im gas pipeline and feed stock wey dey connect all di 10 NIPP GenCon .
wen dem tok power distribution , di report tok say di NIPP intervention bin don see di completion of ovr 360 NIPP injection substations wit a combined capacity wey reach 3 , 540 MW .
To complement dis substations , NDPHC don build about 2 , 600KM of 11KV power distribution lines and 4600KM of 33KM distribution lines wey dey supply electricity directly to transformer
Dia bin dey 296 appointed project wey dem don distribute , wich injection substations dey inside , 1924 of 33kv lines , 4600km of 11kv lines wit dem oda infastruction
NDPHC sef don increase im distribution capacity wit di installation of 25 , 900 completely self - protected ( CSP ) transformer wey dey across obodo , nah Mr Ugbo add dis one .
On top all dis achivement wey don help to improve di operation of national grid , di report highlight threat to di infastructure especially for di one wey dey di power distribution level .
Some of di wahala wey NDPHC dey see for dis distribution be say dem dey tif dia equipment and infrastructure , vandalism , and lack of cooperation from Distribution companies ( DisCos
Di oda nah community wahala wey dey regard land and Right of way ( ROIs ) , motor accident wey don damage some power infrastructure and rising insecurity wey dey facility areas , e start
for a comment wey go empty di property of di NIPP intervention to Nigerian wey dey comsume electricity , di President for di Nigeria consumer Protection Network ( NCPN ) , Barrister Kunle Kola Olubiyo , im tok say di reason for di power sector privatatization exercise wey dem conclude for November 2013 hapen to promote competitive economy and inclusive growth by
Im howeva tok say despite dis , di sector neva reach dat kin viability , so di goment need to deepen di interventions tru NIPP .
On top all di tremendous milestone wey NIPP / NDPHC don achieve , dia bin major area of impediment wey dey full realizeation of di lofty idea wey di management of NDPHC championed .
Mr Olubiyo tok say di wahala dem dey face include delay in taking over projects by di DisCos wich dem suppose capture for dia capital Expenditure ( CAPEX )
Im continue im tok say nah di Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission ( NERC ) bin di inderance for di delay in di implementaion of di regulations of eligeable consumer
wit di kin huge power assets wey NIPP don provide , di Manufacturers Association of Nigeria ( MAN ) and oda dedicated power users fit decide to connect to di NIPP plants and facilities directly and dey enjoy uninterrupted power supply , but dis bin dey delay .
Anoda wahala wey NDPHC dey get nah funding , wich im think say di equity stakeholders suppose raise for more power sector projects .
Di leadearship of di power sector go need to address di low tariff wey dey NIPP plants and di low load ( Energy ) dispatch wey dey available units from TCN
Consumer dem dey look for more electricity , why energy from NIPP GenCos con dey restricted ?
Nah so Olubiyo ask .
unlike oda places , Ramadan season for Nigeria don unfortunately turn into a season wey dey get unnecessary controversy
Di controvercy don start from di arrival of di Ramadan crescent wey dey usher in di new month and di moon go waka commot to show e end .
di Ramadan peroid dey equally witness controversy ova ideological , jurisprudential or political stances wey some Ulama expressed for di course of dia Quranic trfseer sessions
ova many many years , dia bin don dey unnecessary controversy ova say wich charitable work better pass between make dem dey suponsor broadcast Quranic tafseer abi make dem dey do charitable mass feeding of di needy for Ramadan .
As e dey go for oda Muslim societies , Ramadan dey always inspire a phenomenal risefor individual and for societal spirituality for Nigeria wer plenty wealthy pipo dey sponsorlive or recorded broadcast for Quranic tafseer by different Ulama
Many oda pipo dey spend more on top charitable feeding of di poor .
Howeva , while almost , if no be all , who dey sponsor di broadcast tafseerb dey spend for di charitable feeding too , no be all wey dey spend for charitable feeding dey suponsor di broadcast of tafseer .
Ramadan period for northern Nigeria , television and radio stations dey make profit wit di sale of airtime for tafseer and oda religious lectures wey individual , firms and groups sponsor
from di kin number of sponsor broadcast of tafseer an dem oda religious lecture wey dey for like 10 radio stations for Kano , for example , one fit begin dey wonda weda dem dey do oda programme for Ramadam period .
E good say dem dey sponsor tafseer broadcast , especially for Ramadan , di amount wey dem dey spend for dis regard be like say im dey imbalance if we consider di kin hunger wey dey wire di needy
afta all , if dem get chance to choose , dem go certainly choose food hangout ova dat kin sponsored broadcast , as e don be say public tafseer session dey evriwia for Ramadan wey persin fit choose wich to attend .
Besides , di kin underlying dynamics and politics wey dey for sponsoring Ramadan tafseer broadcast , persin no fit rule out Riyaa , sectarian and even political interest wey be di main motives for di sponsor of tafseer and dem oda religious lectures .
Wetin dey interesting be say , while some sponsor dey compete for who go sponsor di broadcast of tafseer wey some prominent Ulama dey anchor , some of di Ulama dey sponsor dia own broadcast tafseer even if dem no see persin wey wan sponsor ; odas even dey beg for sponsor wey go sponsor dia programme .
Also , di content wey some tafseer and oda religious lectures dey feature get some serious flaws , to dey sponsor dis kin broadcast nah big misplacement of priority
anoda thing wey dey interesting be say , some dey sponsor di broadcast of Adhan ( Kiran sallah ) for inside city like Kano .
wia , thank you to sheer wey dey increase for Mosques , regular Adhan don dey reach evri corner
Anyway , Ikhlas bin di ogbonge yardstick way dey determine if weda charitable feeding and di sponsoring of Ramadan tafseer broadcast dey worthy or not , striking appropriate balance between di two go give better outkom .
Even though say Ramadan be di month of di Quran wey be say Muslims suppose dey commited in terms of reading , learning wetin im mean and to dey live dia lives accordingly
Di month nah di month of generous charity wey be say Muslims , particularly di ones wey dey wealthy suppose dey do charity work , especially mass feeding .
Howeva , while dat one com be di bottom line , wich explain why di controversy no dey necessary , di Liberal Musilims don over do am
capitalizing on top public frustration wey dey inside di hunger wey dey wire di society , dem dey kwesion weda di sponsoring of di broadcast Ramadan tafseer dey worthy or relevance for under dis kin condition wey we dey find ourselves .
As dem don pretend show empathy and concern , dey tok say di two charity work be di same and make pipo choose between dem .
Under di hard condition wey pipo dey , e no surprise to dey see many pipo , including di ones wey fit discern , fall for di propaganda wey dem no know e context , nah im be di raging face - off wey dey between di Liberal Muslims , for anoda side , dem bin wan undermine Islamic and moral values for di society by force , togada with di
Also , contrary to wetin dem claim , di Liberal Muslims no dey disturb by di kin wahala wey dey for di vulnerable , dis don explain why dem neva urge those wey dey spend huge resources on top oda things , no mater how worthless im be , make dem divert di resources to charitable course .
Dem neva urge dat di kin massive amounts of resources dia elite role spend on top say dey wan maintain dia big lifestyles suppose dey diverted for di feeding of di poor or to take give dem shelter
Instead , dia conscience go kom alive wen resources dey for only , say , Hajj , Umrah , Daourh
Federers conqueror dey amazed by dream day wey dey di office
Afta im don wreck , Roger Federers return to di tennis courts , Pablo Andujar tok say dat na di sweetest moment a lengthy career .
Spaniard beat Federer 6 - 4 , 4 - 6 , 6 - 4 on top di Geneva clay for Tuesday to scata di swiss tennis great hopes wey dem wan use run di match togeda ahead different major tournaments wey French open , Wimblendon and di Tokyo olympics .
For match point on Tuesday , Andujar , wey be di world number 75 , hold im head for im hand in disbelief afta he don beat di 20 - time Grand slam champion .
I no fit believe am , nah wetin di 35 - year - old tell ATPTour . com .
Di memories of Nigeria colo wey dey for black and white ( iii )
sometimes afta dat , and afta I don get like two popular strip wey dey for di now default news paper wey dem dey call The Democrat , I get my first four letters wey reject me from Mavel Comics , I gada myself remain a young man wey still get hope .
with di kin ups and downs wey dey for Nigeria , im still allow me get dream , to be artist wey dey work for a ogbonge culture company wey for anoda kontiri , anoda continent
Fast - forward to 20002 , one day as I dey sit down for di post office wey dey di centre of di city to drop off my latest art sample to Marvel Submission Editor , I no fit get bus
Plenty pipo dey use leg take waka , some gada for group , dem dey worry .
I dey weird out , waka go home , only to hear say raiot don start .
again , many pipo die for di riot , farmilies and friends tear apart as Christian dey beingn move to Kaduna South and Muslims begin move from Kaduna South to di North
My Kaduna , my Nigeria , don dey fall apart .
Di small consolation wey I get be some Christian friend wey stay for certain areas , like me , dem feel safe and no go anywia
So , as di violence dey intense for oda parts , I go dey play soccer for my street , dey exchange VHS tapes and bootlegs VCDs
Di idea to dey hate persin bikos of im religion or ethnic dey incredible for us .
But one teen , wey just move to our domot some years , nah im make me get encounter with intolerance .
if to say we be Muslims , playing soccer , dis new guy call us make we go attack di infidel wey dey live down di road .
we com look each oda jokingly , we dey confuse , afta wich we burst to laughter , we com tell say make im get out .
As if dat one no bad reach , my heartbreak for don worse as I see di apprearance of labels and slur from both of dem .
My perfect Kaduna don dey fall apart , and families and friends don dey part ways , no be say dem no love each oda but bikos say dat na di safest thing to do .
afta di wahala don end , I begin face university with cautious optimism .
literally , many old friend dey there , as Zaria no too far from Kaduna .
Many pipo dey get new friend , some dey till today , some don dey stronger
The best part be say , all dis friend dem weda new or old , no dey base on religion or ethnicity
Some of us wey notice know say , di Kaduna wey we know , love and don lose , neva really destroy .
E no fit go bikos say nah for our heart im reside , so e go hard to kil patapata
Afta all di almost 29 years wey I don spend as a journalist , show me things wey plenty pipo no fit experience for dia life .
I get front row seat to fight for , gbege attack , concerts by superstars dem , movies premieres and all kin generation - defining moments
I also get to dey interview for some big big newsmaker wey dey Nigeria , during moment wey dem get most chutzpah , or nothin at all .
Nah di Nigeria wey no get worrior wey no fit fight for social justice , virtue - signalers , outrage - peddlers , or cancel culture - purveyor .
Nah di Nigeria wey dey flawed , still dey remind me of my old Kaduna , even though di image different to each oda .
But bodi no fit take all of dem for too long .
On top of bed , I con look around my old room again , evrithin just dey as I leave am before im coronavirus lockdown .
I com smile to myself , nah from dat moment I begin to dey decide on di kin steps wey I go take .
I com twist di rubber band round di sack of fotos two times , com put am back for inside longbox .
Maybe one day I go look oda ones , di colour foto , wey carry more recent memories .
Maybe I no go do am .
One thing dey clear say : nah my mother , and father , and di kin relationship wey dem get or wey dem no get wit me , nah im make me di kin child wey I be .
Wetin I be to oda kids wey know me , also di kin man wey I be , to pipo wey know me .
But I find am as wahahla , and e dey relieve more for my sack of black and white fotos , I don realize say while my head guide di kin persin wey I be , nah my heart don dey keep me Nigerian all dis years .
42 Niger communities wey dey under Boko Haram dey control Senator Musa .
Di Senator wey dey represent Niger East for di National Assembly , Senator Mohammed Sani Musa , im tok say about 42 communities wey dey Niger State don fall under Boko Haram control .
Dem don showcase 5 , 000 villagers for di last three days .
Dis dey kom after Niger state governor , Sani Bello , don raise alarm say di insurgents don hoist dia flag for some communities .
Speaking on di ground of senate on Tuesday while dem dey move on a motion on di kilins wey dey apun for Shiroro , Muya and Rafi local goment areas for Niger state , Senator Musa tok say bandit and terrorist don kil ova 475 persins for Niger East between 2020 till date .
Di lawmakers don express im worry dat almost seven years now Niger East Senatorial Districts wey dey Niger Delta don dey under eviriday and dey sustain plenty deadly attack by heartless , venomous , hydraheaded Boko Haram terrorist .
Di result don dey total collapse wey dey di local economies of di affected victims , total collapse of educational system for di affected areas , famine don dey bikos of di collapse of agricultural activities , displacement wey be as a result of distortion of crisis prone areas , depopulation as a result of wanton death , wey dey among odas .
Im tok say di attack are taking places for di absence of di slightest hindrances , resistance of confrotation from authorities .
Dem don kidnap many and don seize dem wives from dem com forcefully attached dem to Boko Haram members .
Three military camps wey dey Allour , Bassa and Zagzaga for di two local goment area don get sack , di insurgents don kil some security personnel in di last one month of di renewed attack
I fit confirm am authoritatively say Boko Haram terrorist don mount dia flags for many places wey dem don capture like Kure , Alour and Magani
Dey don abandoned pipo wey dey dis wat - torn part of di states and leave dem make dem face dia wahala , make dem dey in agony wey no get end and dey deep inside poverty .
futhermore , for dis moment primary schools for Gwada , Kuta , Pandogari and Minna dem don carry dem do IDP camp as dem dey follow di sacking of almost 5600 villagers from dia ancestral homes in Shiroro , Rafi and Munya local goment area for di last few weeks by di armed rubber wey don raid di town and villages .
Wetin dis mean be say if dey fit attack without hindrance for Niger East Senatorial districts .
I no know how we wan take bikom safe for Abujan again .
Im tok say March 2021 to date some jaguda don kil more 25 gallant soldier dem , policemen and oda security personnel while 16 civillians die , and dem no fit account for many odas .
If dem no address dis threat drastically , di attack go continue and di danger wey day dat one be say e fit bikom wetin we no fit handle further to oda communities .
Wey bin farming communities and dem bin farmers , dem fit comot dia farm dis season and dis fit negatively affect food surficiency and economic diversification policy of di Federal Goment , im added .
My visit go Adamour state
Working wit di goment for any level don offer innovators like me di chance to dey bring more beta and transformation wey we ordinarily no fit do for our field
I strongly believe say di goment , as institution , be di greatest vehicle for systemic change and positive transformation wey persin no fit find anywia .
For dat , weneva I kom across opportunities to work wit dem goment bodi , weda local or nah for outside country , I dey always dey hapi bikos say e represent a great opportunity for me learn from and fit contribute to di civil service wey dey fields dat are exciting and dey transformative for pipo beyond wetin my
One of my recent visit of such nature nah to Adamour state , wey dey fascinating for me bikos of im diversity , resilience and outstanding potencial .
I begin dey work actively for Adamour state some years ago , wit di international organisation , OXFAM , on top a project wey dey in line wit European Union's support to food security and resilience for Nothen Nigeria were we deployed a mobile solution to integrating di agricultural value chain .
We don work wit field officers wey dey represent Fufore , Guyuk , Mubi South and Song local goment areas wey dey Adamour state to enhance agriculture and Agricbusiness practices wit tecnology .
Howeva , my return to Adamour state last year dey towards a grannder and dey get more exciting task .
E don involve a preposition to take work wit di state goment to transform di ministry of Entrepreneurship and Development and poverty Alliviation togeda wit di wealth creation Agency ( PAWECA ) wit di general aim of how to dey reduce poverty and dey sustainably dey improve prosperity for di teeming young pipo wey dey di state .
For some context , I dey very delighted to learn dat di state goment don establish di ministry of entrepreneurship and Development wey go help lay focus on entrepreneurship and to acquire technical skil .
E no exist untill di goment of Ahmadu Umar Fintiri administration com establish am , di ministry don bikom di key pillar of di administration strategies wey dey towards economic development of di state .
Di role of dis institution dey sailent as im supporse be for Adamour state , wit im fair share of youth unemployment , security and oda challenges .
Im dey , howeva , very very evident dat the Adamour state ministry of Entrepreneurship and development , togeda wit Poverty Alleviation and Wealth Creation Agency ( PAWECA ) , e fit dey adequately utilised for trasforming di local economy , boosting youth entrepreneurship and to dey reduce unemployment drastically for di state .
But as im be for most goment institutions , dis dey require discipline and dedicated effort to fit achieve dem
Typically , for wia dey exist , complex international organisational challenges don shackle di growth and efficiency of dis kin institutions .
For persin to understand dis conundrum , I tok to Adamour state's secretary to di state goment , Malam Bashiru Ahmed , who no dey only passionate about di issue but dey remarkably informed about local and global effort wey dey around am and as such uniquely position to help chat oury solving am
Im repeat Governor Fintiri commitment to take solve youth wey no get job and enhance di local economy by boosting entrepreneurship .
Malam Bashiru don express im idea and understanding wey dey around reforming and improving di capacity of ministries and agencies of goment , arguing dat di desire transformation only fit be possible if dem enhance di culture of innovation , embrace di use of technology , and if dem improve internal processeces and procedures so dat
Nah bikos of di challege wey most public and private institution dey seek to solve continue to dey generate demands wey only technologically savvy , innovation - driven , forward thinking , and efficient institution fit do .
In di course of di weeks to follow afta dis encounter , I also meet di Commissioner of di Ministry of Entrepreneurship and Youth Development , Ilya James and di head of Poverty Alliviation and Wealth Creation ( PAWECA ) Hajiya Aisha Bello , make dem examine wetin dem have and dia lay grounds for developing initiatives base on
we wan establish organisational culture wey dey efficient and fit give result and go equip di ministry and agency to bikom innovation - driven through di use of technology .
In a way wey dey demostrable and fit give result we go initiate human - centre design thinking among staff and optimaize internal processes to ensure quality service delivery
last last , we go offer tools wey go dey for di monioring and measuring of organaisational performance of di ministry agency .
Dis go go hand in hand for di already existing togada wit newly - hatched programs and campaings of di two institutions

Has dem don mismanage dem opportunities to initiate all di recommendations dem wey dem bin don propose by di PDP governors dem between 1999 and 2015 , how anybodi for inside PDP go dey claim any moral standing to dey demand for any executive bill ?
If to say di issue is dey as simple as getting di President to transmit executive bill , wetin stop all di PDP President dem from initiating am for sixteen years ?

Im tok say di elevation of Yahaya above im seniors dem nah direct hit against di military , wich go see senior , capable officers dem wey dem purge through compulsory retirement as we dey see am for di past .

Abia goment don reject IPOB strategy , dey demand for apology ova di war crimes wey dem hold against Igbos
Di Abia State Governor , Dr . Okezie Ikpeazu don explain why im differed wit di strategy of di Indigenous pipo of Biafra ( IPOB ) secession and dia strategy for gbege .
Im tok on Friday wen im visit di digital pan - African news network , di TOS TV network , wey Ms . Osasu Igbinedion led for inside Abuja .
Di governor wey fault di strategy wey IPOB deployed led by self - exiled Nnamdi Kanu , dem howeva note dat dem no dey treat di Ndigbo fairly inside di kontiri .
According to im , di destructive strategy of IPOB bin di recipe for di breakdown of law and order inside di South East geopolitical zone .
As dem bin dey listen to oda reasons why im differ wit IPOB , di governor bin tok , But some of us no agree with im ( Nnamdi Kanu ) style bikos I no understand wia im dey go , wen im intend to pull di brakes and wen im go stop .
If to say I get a way wey I fit convey my view to di leadership of di group wetin I go tok be say make dem find di way to enter into conversation and let pipo know .
I no understand dia strategy and purpose .
I no understand why dem dey attack institutions of civil rule .
Plenty pipo dem wey dey apologetic to some of dis dem strategies no even know say dem dey ride for tigers tail .
If di police and military withdraw and den brigands becom enforcers of di law and order , if you get quarrel wit your broda , how you wan take resolve am ?
While we still dey demand for national apology for di kin treatment dem dey meted to di Igbos during di nation's three - year civil war , Governor Ikpeazu tok say our national orientation suppose dey willing to say sorry .
No persin fit dey 100 percent korekt all in life
Even wen we wey deal wit our pikin dem if we do things wey no dey right , we suppose get di courage to come down to dia level and tell dem sorry but to create a utopian aura dat all dey well is either nothing is wrong
or I don do am , wetin you fit do ?
Who fit tell us wetin apun for civil war , who do wetin and why dem do am ?
why be say say some pipo no fit kom tell us say dem sorry for we dem do ?
you no fit sweep somethings under di carpet .
Di tension dey palpable and dis nah di time for us to dey open up up as pipo wey love dem kontiri .
I dey speak like dis bikos say I spend seven years inside di University of Maguduri .
I don waka through all part of northern Nigeria
and I don sabi dis kontiri
I feel bad say wetin dey bring us togeda don dey gradually go oury .
Di NYSC don collapse
We suppose dey tok di truth no matta whose o dem form .
Some of di issues wey Nnamdi raise nah issues of injustice , marginalisation , inequality weda nah gender , generational whateva .
Any particular arm of di society wey dem exclude in any way get di right to feel say dem cheat am or dey unwanted .
so , some of di things Nnamdi tok dey valid .
some of us fit see am .
we no fit dey continue to dey run oury from di facts
Di Islamic Movement of Nigeria ( IMN ) don accuse di FCT police command of harassment and intimidation .
Di group wey protest ova di continued detention of im leader , Ibraheem El - Zakzaky at Wuse Market , Abuja , yesterday , claim say di police throw teargas and shot at di protesters dem .
A statement wey Abdullahi Musa sign , on behalf of di Academic Forum of di IMN , tok say the police bin dey harass so many innocent pipo dem including passers - by , especially women while dem dey attempt to scatta di protesters .
We kom out as usual on di streets of Abuja dey halla on di Nigerian authorities make dem respect the rule of law and make dem free our leader unconditionally and also to remind di general public dat in 2015 within 48hrs d kil ova 1000 of im followers mercilessly by the officers and soldiers of the Nigerian Army as dem don officially launch attack on im inside im own residence , dem kil almost evri soul wey dey inside di house and com set dia corpses ablaze .
Musa don add say dat di protest be don start for around 3 : 00 for afternoon and dey go serere from Sky Memorial but just dem wan scatta for Wuse Market , di police arrive and start to dey shoot teargas and life ammunition on di peaceful and unarmed protesters .
Di police harass plenty innocent pipo including pipo wey dey pass by wich plenty of dem be women and dem removed dia hijabs , im tok further .
di FCT police command spokespesin , ASP Maryam Yusuf , tok say di group dey disturb public peace wit dia protest .
NAPTIP arraigns , dem reunite five trafficked children wit dia parents .
Di FCT police command spokespesin , ASP Maryam Yusuf , tok say di group dem dey disturb public peace wit dia protest .
NAPTIP , for di press briefing at di weekend , tok say Abdulrahman , a 32 - year - old man , him abducted children wey dem dey di age of four to seven and sell dem to some women wey dey different parts of di kontiri wey dey under di guise of say im adoption dem .
Di Director General , Mrs . Imaan Sulaiman - Ibrahim , wen im dey hand ova di children to dia parents im say , di suspect tell di would be parents adoption papers purportedly from di Niger State Goment .
She tok say , dem catch am red handed wen im dey help im clients fill dia adoption application forms .
She warn say make parents dem dey guard dia children dem to avoid kidnapping wey dey apun , trafficking and oda crimes dem wey dey against humanity , she add say make dem no expose dem to pipo wey get criminal intention .
She tok say di pesin wey dey investigate di matta don follow an intelligence report dat Abdulrahman kidnapped children from Niger State and com sell dem into different parts of di kontiri .
Di DG also tok say di intelligence report don reveal that di suspect bin don dey do dat claiming to be a staff of di Ministry of Social Development of Niger State wey dey in charge of adoption dem matta .
She tok say Abdulrahman don confess say im don collect di sum of N100 , 000 for each of di children .
Di parents dem don laud di federal goment and NAPTIP management for rescuing dia children and don promise to take proper care of dem .
Governors dem wey dem elect on di platform of di pipos Democratic parti ( PDP ) don warn di Economic and Financial Crime Commission ( EFCC ) make dem no dey witch - hunt im parti officials dem .
Di governors dem don dey respond to di invitation of three officials of di parti by di antigraft agency ova alleged misappropriation of N10 billion , which the Secondus - led National Working Committee ( NWC ) wey dem don already deny .
di forum , for di statement by im Director - General , Hon CID Maduabum , tok say di invitation of di officials ova a spurious petition by a disgruntled former member of PDP don raise quesion on di seriousness and impartiality of di anti - graft agency to do im work .
Di statement tok : While PDP as a political parti dey accountable to im members dem and di general public for im actions , we dey , howeva , concerned dat di old tactics of using di EFCC to dey silence political opposition don dey entre into our polity again .
we think say di EFCC wey dey di new leadership go learn from di mistake of pipo wey dey before am .
Nah misplaced priority e be for EFCC to dey abandon revelations of big big fraud wey many officials and agencies of di Federal goment dey do to pursue di PDP wey be di main opposition parti doing a yeoman's job to dey prevent di descent into chaos and anarchy for inside Nigeria .
Maybe some interests inside goment dey worried about di increasingly assertive role di PDP dey play in calling out corruption inside goment and wan to weaken and silence am .
Even di message wey dem dey tok about no make any allegation of misuse of goment funds , or cheating of any persin or public authority by di PDP .
E dey surprising dat EFCC wan use im scarce human and oda resources to begin investigation into PDP finances .
If EFCC dey even - handed and dey non - partisan , e suppose conduct investigation into oda political parties including APC , wey be di ruling party .
PDP dey up to date for making financial returns as di required by the Constitution to INEC
We no know say INEC don make complaints to EFCC on PDP's return .
We dey face existential threats as a nation and PDP suppose remain focus on im role as a watchdog on behave of Nigerians .
Di Senator wey dey represent Kaduna Central , Uba Sani , don lament say children be di one wey dem dey suffer most for di kontiri recurring economic and security wahala dem .
For di children's day message , Sani note say children don dey face di deprivation bikos of di insecurity wey dey many kontiri .
some of dem don dey stuck for inside Internally Displaced Persins ( IDPs ) camps .
dia education don suffer
plenty of dem no get access to healthcare .
Dem no get any recreation for dem
Dem dey abuse some of di girls .
Dem dey live inside di fear of di unknown .
Make we dey reflect on top our children loss of dia innocence and our duties dem and obligation wey we don lose as leaders and pipo .
plenty of dem die bikos say dem no get health care
Di economic impact of COVID - 19 on dia parent dey affect di children in a nagative way .
Di quality of food wey dem dey chop don reduce to and some of dem no fit go school again , nah wetin im tok be dat .
Di lawmaker don call for effective implementation of policies and programmes wey go aim at providing betta education and betta health care for di children
Di investment wey put for our children nah di investment wey we put for di future of our kontiri .
Im add say , make we no fail for dis regards .
Wetin dey fuel insurgency ?
Wen a group of pipo wey no dey informed get an idealogy wey dey fit die for , dem go do di illogical for am .
Di kind intercourse wey dey between ideology and ignorance no dey follow logic .
Dem consider murder as di sin wey dealy pass for Igbo land .
In fact , for di old days if dem committe murder , di community go proceed on many days of cleansing of di land and atonement for di crime .
Wetin change now ?
plenty pipo don assume dat di Igbo are natively no dey violence and dat dey cannot in any circumstances dey take innocent lives violently .
Di Igbo pipo dey very peaceful , but wetin dey apun recently inside South - east don make us to dey doubt di assumption
All di regions inside di kontiri don dey marginalise as regards say di equitable distribution of resources to di pipo .
To dey clear , nah evri region don dey marginalise
Di statement wey dey more factual go be all Nigerians wey dey di bottom rung of di social ladder dey marginalise .
Nah Nigerians be victims of di carnivory of di elite .
E no mata say dem com from di North or di south .
Nah all of us be victims of elite conspiracy e no mata wia we kom from .
E dey so agonising say di scion of di south - east don dey turn dia region into Aleppo inside Syria .
Nah who bring war and violence into im own home ?
As of 2019 , di south - east dey reputed say e dey very safe pass any oda region for inside Nigeria .
E dey very buoyant and dey well fared on top di development inside index .
All of dat don dey tremble down .
Di kilin of police officers some of dem Igbo di targeting of northern residents ; di destruction of property and arsoning of police stations dem be di tragedies wey no suppose apun .
Dem dey fed di cancer and dem allow am spread throughout di bodi .
Di Igbo dem nourish dis beast wey dey gnawing at dia groin .
Wen dem start di serial murder of police officers , some clap for di effort of dia kilers on di inscrutable assumption say di police dey inside cahoots wit criminals to destroy Igbo land .
Now , di destruction of di region no dey for di hands of some herdsmen or bandits , but for di might of di sons of di land .
How you wan take define irony ?
Dem dey threaten di Igbo pipo wey get different opinions to di group sentiments wit violence .
Dem no know di Igbo to get strong head or conscripted into tyranny of opinions and actions
Dem know Igbo to be republican ; dem dey open to robust arguments and dem dey subject evri thought to scrutiny .
Wetin com change ?
He be like say di kilin of police officers inside di south - east bin don dey unmitigated and security agencies don appear to don leave di pipo to dia own fate .
Armed robber dem don return at scale .
Nah dis be pipo lamentation evriwia .
A lady wey share her experience of how a mechanic wey she pay upfront to fix her car inside Anambra runaway wit di moni and automobile , and even threatened her while im dey brag , police no dey inside di south - east again .
Jaguda don take control of interest areas inside di region .
Fear and wahala dey evriwia .
Life don bikom nasty , brutish and short inside a region wey dey peaceful before .
As a mata of fact , we dey on a familiar path albeit dey dangerous
Di signs dey very tragic
Pikin wey dem born for Nigeria in 2000 fit tell how Boko Haram take start inside North - east .
Di militant groups dey ourys target di security agents and formations eviritime .
Wen dey take dem out , di pipo no go fit defence demselves and di armed gangs go start a new order of violence .
Dem don kill securities and dem destroy security facilities in di South - east now
Afta di security scaffold don dey decimated , innocent pipo wey dey live di area and even those wey dey satisfied ova di revelry of blood fit bikom di next victims .
Dem be displaced persins wey dey live inside IDP camps for inside part of Eboyi state displace , dis apun as a result of interncine clashes among communities .
Wit di kin prevailing savagery wey di secessionist group , there go be more refugee problem inside south - east if dem continue wit di attack .
wia dey wan put pipo wey be say wetin dem dey do nah buying and selling ?
we no fit end dis barbarity if we no agree
If some pipo choose to keep native sympathies for pipo wey dey take innocent lives , how go fit stop di bloodletting stop ?
E dey for our hand .
Marwa don meet wit IGP , tok say Buhari don demand mopping up of dugs wey no dey legal .
President Muhammadu Buhari dan order di National Drug Law Enforcement Agency ( NDLEA ) make dem mop up all drugs wey no dey legal and substances inside di kontiri make Nigeria bikom a drug - safe haven .

So far , we know say about 15 million Nigerians dey use drug , number dey very high and we dey work on di mandate wey di President give us to mop up all illicit substances and make Nigeria bikom a drug - safe haven , di NDLEA don remain upstanding by radiating up our activities .

We don seized dis drugs to di value of N80bn , we do arrest 2 , 100 criminals wey dey associated wit dis illicit trade and we don secure ova 350 convictions so far .
We stil dey count by di grace of God
Some of our officers dem dey involve in seizures of drugs wich dey okay .
But dem suppose hand over to NDLEA afta dat .
Marwa tok say nah very few pipo proceed wit prosecuting those cases , dem no suppose do am since nah NDLEA dey in charge .
While dem dey seek make dem join bodi wit di police for di next phase of flushing out drug barons , im express optimism say more of dis barons dem go kom into di agency net .
We belive say di NPF go support us wit intelligence tracking , e dey possible say di NPF don alredy do am .
We ask for slot for inside police institutes so we fit bikom beneficiaries .
We go appoint liaison officer between us so we go fit ensure definite contact .
We need to dey renew di join bodi wey dey between us bikos di use of drugs don dey confirmed as a major precursor to criminal activities wey dey inside Nigerial .
Marwa tok say nah dis time dem suppose join bodi more .
As im dey speak ealier , IGP recall say im bin Borno State Police Public Relation Officer for dat time .
Nah Marwa be di Military Administrator .
Experience nah im be di best teacher , you don dey for dis business of crime prevention and control .
We dey here to declare to you my unalloyed cooperation .
We go join bodi and synergize wit di angency so we go fit police dis kontiri .
For evri crime , we dey always get issue of drug .

As im dey address parti supporters dem at di Benin airport yesterday , Obaseki tok say im victory also dey for freedom for Edo pipo .
For us wey dey inside Edo , dis victory means freedom and emancipation ; e means say we must rededicate ourselves to our pipo bikos democracy dey all about di pipo .
Democracy no dey for individual or godfather .
We don already defeat di godfather finally for inside Edo , so we fit to take Edo to wia e should be , im tok .
Im believe say , dey don go through plenty hurdles in di last two or three years in di effort to reposition di politics of di state .
Inside di congratulatory messages by di candidate of di APC , Osagie Ize - Iyamu and a former national chairman of the parti , Adams Oshiomhole to im , Obaseki tok say im neva receive original copies of di letterswey di duo sign .

Di INEC REC tok say all di new PUs go dey stationed inside di public places , dem don add dat no one go dey situated for individual residences , palaces , houses of politicians or places of worship .
Okoye tok say , di last time INEC created new Pus nah for 1996 wen we get only 50 million voters wey dey registered
But for 2019 , di number don increase to ova 84 million .
Im clare am say di exercise no go fit add to number of voters wey dey registered .
Di INEC Commissioner also don tok , wit di Continuous Voter Registration Exercise wey go begin for June 28 , di commission don introduce innovation wey be say voters who be technology guru go fit do dia registration online , com go to dia respective registration areas to do dia biometrics and pictures captured .
Im believe say dis go reduce di kin crowd wey go dey di centres , e go also make di process dey easy .
Daily Trust don report say di meeting wey dem do in attendance representatives of political parties inside di state , heads of all security agencies inside di state , traditional and religious leaders and non - gomental organisations .

For December 2019 , I write article about Thomas Cook , wey be di first - eva travel agency and how dat firm accidentally establish tourism as we know am today
opposition wey dey kom from di herders , though na from di Fulani pipo e plenti pass , e kom still dey among di farmers wey no want make pastolist dem enjoy di benefit of di plan sef , dey spoil di reform effort
Distrust don plenti for Middle belt , place wey be say fight between farmers and herders too plenti bikos of land , even though peacemakin and effort wey di military dey take since 2018 don reduce di blood shed
Shortage don dey federal and state goment budget , small part na bikos of di economy wey spoil bikos of di pandemic , and bikos di kontri no get technical experts wey know how dem take dey manage ranch and grazin reserve
For many states , especially for North - West , di way wey criminal gang and group dem wey get arm dey grow dey spoil access to grazin reserves and e dey make pipo wey wan invest before no do am again
unless dey do somethin about am , dis kasala and oda ones fit delay or make e spoil di plan , wey go make di kontri dey helpless wen di fight between farmers and herders dey serious pass before own , wey fit kom turn fight between ethnic group , region and religion
To tackle dis kasala , e go dey important make Federal and State authority join hand make effort , wit donors and investors help .
First , make Abuja and oda states wey dey support am provide political leadership wey strong pass before , make dey kom increase dia communication wit public , so dem go fit spoil pipo doubt and wrong understanding of di plan
Dis one dey common pass for pastoralists dia side , wey go ask dem make dem change dia nomadic lifestlye wey dey wit dia pipo for centuries , wey still get serious doubt say di plan promise about pasture na lie .
But many farmers dey fear say dem go lose dia land give pipo wey dey produce livestock .
Many pipo for di middle Belt and oda states for di South still dey suspect di plan long - term goals , wey dem dey see as opportunity for herders and di Fulani people particularly
Wit di support from Abuja and oda partners , state goments go need find pipo wey go be expert , wey go know technical aspect of thins , especially pipo wey go dey manage di ranch and grazin reserve , dairy production and meat processin
Make Federal and State goment sef increase dia budget for di plan , release di fund quick and make dey kom create financial transparency to make sure say evrithin dey accounted for , to dey work wit donors and investors wey necessary
E dey important sef to dey deal wit insecurities wey dey rural area , to dey curb impunity and to dey kom rehabilitate communities wey di fight affect seriously for di states wey dey participate .
Authorities go need consider weather change mata join , make dem decide if herders from oda kontris sometimes go benefit from di plan sef
As some of dis step go take time , make di pipo wey dey plan am focus on how dem go fit bring result wey strong , wey pipo go fit see for small time
less dan two years from now , di kontri go hold general election
if di plan go survive di change of goment wey go follow , Politians go need bring proof wey clear say e get benefit ( Change dey certain , as president Buhari and many state governor dem no go fit compete again as dey don serve two term )
By di time wey champaign for election don dey hot for 2022 endin , di pipo wey dey back di plan suppose fit show some of di ranch wey dem build or di reserve wey dem repair , strong donor wey dem get and dia investors commitment and di first group of pipo wey dey don train to be professional for Livestock mamagement
Nothin for dis thin dey easy but di plan worth di effort
No be say e perfect , but e bring chance wey dey important , chance to change Nigeria livestock system wit strategy wey go address wetin both herders and small - scale farmers need .
About 70 percent pipo wey dey work for Nigeria dey get moni from Agriculture
To modernise di Livestock sector go boost di kontri prosperity and for di same time , na one big way to solve one of Nigeria kasala wey dangerous
As time dey reach for di 2023 election , both federal and state authority go need do quick so pipo go see wetin dem dey do , or else all dia work to create dis kind moment of opportunity go spoil .
Dis na executive summary of di report on top di National Livestock Transformation Plan ( NLTP ) and how dia work go fast , na International Crisis Group publish am

5 years afta : why Nigeria no still see beans export
Nigeria hope to dey export dry cowpea ( beans ) to kontri dem wey dey European Union don spoil
Dis na bikos of di extension of di ban wey dey ground before on top di kontri dry beans by European Union wey go end by 2022
Di EU food safety authority don ban Nigeria beans for 2015 bikos he get like 0 . 3mg per kg to 4 . 6mg per kg Dichlorvos , one pesticide , wey be say di type wey suppose remain no suppose pass na 0 . 01mg per kg
Dey consider say Dichlorvos get poison wey fit kos diffuculty for breathin , diarrhoea , vomitin , convulsion , dizziness and oda sickness sef
experts tok say like many organophosphate ( OP ) insecticide , e get enzyme cholinesterase sef wey dey kos disruption of di nervous system and muscular system
some expert sef claim say some farmers and middlemen dey use Sniper , anoda chemical wey dey deadly use preserve dia beans
Independent investigation wey dis paper conduct last year show say most of di beans for di kontri dey perserved wit chemical wey dey dangerous to human health
One food scientist , Idowu Amusa , list di consequences wey dey di consumption of food wey dem use sniper and oda harmful chemical preserve wey include gastro - intestinal issues , brain and oda internal damage , blood poisonin , food poisonin and e fit kos death
Di EU don extend di ban from 2018 on importation of dry beans from Nigeria until June 2019 bikos of di pesticide wey dey always dey der
Nigeria Agricultural Quarantine Service ( NAQS ) , di kontri produce regulator , don assure di farmers and oda stakeholders before say di kontri dey work hard to ensure say dem lift di ban for 2021
One recent document from EU don announce extension of di ban , he tok say Nigeria no implement di Union food safety plan wey dem submit for 2018
wit di extension , beans wey dem produce for Nigeria no go fit enta any member kontri for European Union .
Na like dis e don be for five years
How e take start
For 2015 , dem reject some beans from Nigeria bikos of di Eu export regulations
One official for NAQS tell awa Agric Editor say as e reach Tin Can Island , di NAQS team go check di consignment and dey discover say some of di containers don dey turn power and dey reject am bikos of di chemical residue
We take awa own analysis from there , kom discover say aside from di pesticide residue wey dey , pest sef dey and na dem kos di powder form of di beans
He tok say di agency don dey carry out serious campaign to explain how and di reason for farmers and middlemen make dem dey preserve dia beans wit acceptable chemical level
Di official , wey no write hin name down , tok say aside from export wahala , to dey chop beans wey dey don too preserve dey dangerous to human and animal health .
Expert tok say Nigeria dey lose billions
One agric economist , Mr Segun Ayeni , tell Daily trust yesterday say Nigeria dey lose billions of naira sake of di ban wey dey kontri beans mata wey EU give dem for 2015 .
He tok say traders and goment no dey see moni from beans value chain bikos of di ban
He tok say all traders wey dey between , di warehouse pipo , di transporters and we , wey dey involve for di inspection and certification , dat aspect don dey broken down bikos e dey no fit generate any revenue for di value chain .
Pipo reaction dem
Di National president of All Farmers Association Nigeria ( AFAN ) , Architect Kabiru Ibrahim , as he react to di ban wey EU give dem , tok say he fit say he no dey connected wit di kontri noncomformity wit di Global Good Agricultural Practice Protocol
For di production , we need deploy good agricultural practice , and for di preservation , make we no use plenti volume of chemicals wey go dey leave residual content wey dem no go accept as wholesome foods for Europe
Dem no think di general ban for EU well bikos some farmers don already dey comply wit di GAP standard dem
He add say dem dey work wit some farmers to ensure say dey comply wit GAP
As di National president of AFAN , I be di Chairman of di National Technical Working Group on Global GAP for Nigeria wey dem inaugurate for 2017 by Di Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development dat time
He tok say various exporters , agribusiness groups , Ministry of Trade and Invesment , SON , NAFDAC , Quarantine Department go need work together , make dem act as one to make wetin we produce acceptable globally

To tame Nigeria oil spillage and gas flarin scourge
E kom from Jerome Mario - Utami
Di recent news report say Okordia - Rumekpe 14 - inch crude truck line wey Shell Petroleum Development Company ( SPDC ) dey operate discharge 213 barrel crude oil for Ikarama community for Bayelsa don reach awa side say though Nigeria wey been dey proud say dey be giant of Africa and di black kontri wey get pipo pass for di world stil dey get plenti third world kasala
As dem dey clarify say na like 1 . 34 hectare land dem pollute wit di leakage wey rupture for di pipeline follow , SPDC confirm say dey finish di investigation of di incident , dey tok say out of 213 of SPDC bonny light crude leak , na like 110 barrel dem see recover for di recovery exercise wey dem dey do for di site , e kom remain 109 . 12 barrel of di volume wey spill .
Admittedly , wetin Dutch oil giant claim na fact wey dem fit verify but e fit no be di only explanation
Notwitstandin dia clarification , reasons dey wey qualify dis kind apunin for Nigeria oil and gas industry as reality wey dey suppose analyse generally
Make we start wit reality
Aside from di awareness say spillage dey happen , communal right for environment wey clean and access for clean water supply na hin dey don violate for dat kind case , wit dia admission , dey don abandon thousands of site wey dey don pollute for di region , wey dem nid identify and study for detail as dey compensate di community wey e affect well for dia loss wella , dis lastest spill apun weeks afta one wey resemble am for one pipeline facility wey rupture wey one International Oil company wey dey operate for Niger Delta
dey manage , wey dem report say destroy Benikrukru and commuinty wey dey around am for Warri South - west local goment Area for Delta state .
And anoda one for early momo on Sunday , March 14 , 2021 for Polubobu / Opuama , Warri North local Goment Area for di state , go fit settle .
Dis kind big scale set of spillage also include but e no dey limited to ; di big spillage wey dey history for place like Ogini land , Rivers State and Erovie community for Ozoro , Isoko North Local Goment for Delta state for 1990s , di two for Nigeria south south zone and negative impact still dey der .
Shey na di only explanation / example dem be dis ?
Di answer na ogbonge
no , as oda ones dey
Oda critical reason / concern dem why we suppose see di situation as crisis .
Di first and veri important na di inability of Nigeria and hin pipo to appreciate and treat activity wey relate to crude oil spillage and environment pollution wey dey kom from exploration / crude oil production as national calamity
Di second na di stunnin conciousness wey gas flarin / environment degradation dey apun bikos of activities wey dey related to crude oil prospectin / production for di kontri dey under - reported .
Dis second concern dey kom from one recent comment , wey be say from media report na from di Director - General , National Oil Spill Detection and Response Agency ( NOSDRA ) , Idris Musa , wey tok say wetin hin agency find show say average of five oil spills na hin Nigeria dey record evriday .
Musa , wey follow journalists tok for Abuja , tok say for 2018 , we get 600 oil spill incident and for 2019 , we get about 700 oil spill - impacted site actross di kontri .
Dis comment wey dey open brain dey more important for wetin we dey discourse if pesin remember say Nigeria accordin to report don get about 139 place wey gas don flare across Niger Delta both for di oil fields wey dey water and di one wey no dey , wer gas wey dey flare dey reach 11 % of evrithin wey dem dey produce .
Pass anything , na di question dem wey e bring kom mind be ; wetin dey stop di development of petroleum sector and Niger Delta region
Shey Legislative work no dey ?
Why dis kind legislative framework no dey provide strong source of solution for pipo and community wey oil exploration and production affect badly for coastal comminity dem ?
If dis framework dey , why e no dey work or make dem do am ?
Shey di framework get evrithin like legal solution for di issues of violations wey relate to oil ?
Why di nation neva learn serious lesson from Dutch goment wia all di pipo wey dey operate must restore wia dem dey operate back to how dey meet am ?
Regardless of wetin oda pipo tok , di truth be say if all of us get am for mind to develop policy wey go bring prosperity for oil and gas sector , while we go still save di pipo for di region , we ready to find di strategic triangles wey hold di key to success for hand .
Apart from di fact say success need make dem analyse am wit care , of di different kind of knowledge wey dem need to make innovation possible , e don necessary for di nation make dem hold di middle ground since both di ministry and sector don dey manifest signs for long time now say dem go be institution wey no get potential wey strong .
And as we know , any organization , whether private or public wey no gree search for hin potential , hin survival na by chance .
For dis level , if we luk di operational template of di ministry , and how dey don know say di up , mid and down stream players of di petroleum industry say dem no dey follow rules , e no go dey wrong make pesin conclude say dem fit divide di serious reasons wey dey kos Crude oil spillage / gas flarin to ; regulatory framework wey plenti wey no dey work , oil and gas exploration and production for Nigeria dey ; federal goment failure to make di kontri refineries dey work to dia full capacity back ; petroleum
ministry inability to make International Oil Companies dey follow di international best practices as e relate to di environment wey dem dey work ; Di last one , clear responsibility / work details wey no dey and action plans for agencies and parastatals wey dey function under di ministry .
Di failures dem wey dey up get direct consequence , na bad influence for di sector , di ministry and di region .
To take explain dis points , make we use di first challenge start , e dey important to dey tok about di law dem wey regulate crude oil exploration and oil production issue wey plenti law dey regulate but too dey weak and di Acts wey dey law wey no dey just complicate how e dey work , but e don too old as time don dey change , e dey create corner corner way for pipo wey dey operate for der especially the International Oil Companies ( IOC ) make dem fit use exploit both di goment and
host communities .
some of dis laws / acts wey we dey tok about don dey since 1960 but dey no dey achieve dia purpose wey Di Petroleum Act of 1969 , Di Harmful Waste ( Special Criminal Positions etc ) , Act 1988 , Mineral Oil Safety Regulation 1963 , Petroleum ( Drillin and Production ) Regulation 1969 dey but no be oly dis one dem .
( Subsidiary Legislation to Petroleum Act ) and di off - shore Oil Revenue ( Registration of Grants ) Acts 1971 among odas .
As dey no mind di number , concept , provision and definition dem , dis law dem no dey useful again , dey don old to di extent say dem dey give pipo wey dey work for di sector corner corner to dey chop both di goment and host community dem .
Utomi na di Programme Coordinator ( Media and Policy ) , Social and Econnomic Justice Advocacy ( SEJA ) , Lagos .
Crystal and Davy ( 1969 ) explain say di language wey journalist dem dey use dey important for di journalism work .
SEC ban CMO wey dey no register from operation May 31

IPOB leader don threaten pipo say hin go dey kil pipo wey no reason wit am
IPOB Emma Powerful don threaten pipo say he go spill blood .
Emma Powerful wey be media and publicity secretary for IPOB threat to dey kil any Igbo pesin wey no follow hin warning don dey too serious , and dey no suppose ignore am except say we no get goment , wer small small fascist like Mr Emma Powerful as he call himsef go dey tok say hin go dey drag pipo kom out , dey send dem go meet Baba God as he tok bikos dey no follow am or hin organization .
Di mouth wey hin dey run no be play ; as e be say di kasala for Nigeria South - east show say na plan dey plan am .
As he no understand how simple Igbo leadership dey be , wey be say dia leader na Onye - oje ozi or servant of hin pipo , wey make di pipo agree wit am afta he don consult plenti pipo , Emma Powerful wey prefer one thug title , Onye - ike , wey be say na to dey force dem , make dem fear am and now he dey threaten to kil di same Ndigbo wey he say he dey fight for .
For man wey be say he no dey tolarate , wey be say to kil pipo take push hin cause no be kasala , di question be say who go wan stay tru tru for Cave Republic wey be say na thug dey run am
Di Biafra wey pipo know for history no be Ndigbo choice ; Na di only choice wey dem force Ndigbo do be dat for dat time , wey dem face bravely wit plenti courage and sacrifice so dem go fit defend and uphold
Biafra no too oppose authority reach how dey try make di pipo right dey valid , no be say make dem just exist , but na to live wit dignity .
Di Biafra wey dey history na like safety precaution for all Igbo pipo wey suppose don too suffer dat time fit kom , place wey dey fit stay safely .
Di declaration and di struggle of di old Biafra no be show or avenue to make moni wey di pipo wey dey lead am dey do pass now .
Before dem declare Biafra for 1967 , Eastern Consultative assembly , one group wey dey represent , still dey advice for all di opinion wey pipo get for east , bikos of wetin dey apun gree say make dem make di declaration wit dia authority .
Na di reason wey make di whole Ndigbo and oda tribe wey no be Igbo , wey sacrifice , wey dem no fit forget gree protect di republic wey still small
As di war dey end sef , wey Biafra don fall , wey evribodi don settle , Ndigbo go back go protect Nigeria , wit clean mind , strong determination and courage , so e go fit work ,
Di context of new Nigeria kasala and disagreement for dia point of view wey dey deep na bikos of one neo - capitalist state wey dey go backward , and di chain of di productive forces , wey dem chain , wey no fit produce di material of hin existence again .
As di new Nigeria kasala dey grow , wey e no dey progress and e slow , di simple tins like tribe , culture and religion dey struggle to preserve , express and recreate diasef .
ova - all , e dey easy to carry retirement flag , wen dey no understand how socio - economic infrastructure dey important if dey wan build kontri wey go survive .
South Sudan wey be Africa last born still dey breastfeed as dia condition now worse pass dia former condition .
Notin show say Biafra current leader wey like to dey make noise know anythin about how dem dey build or create kontri
Even if dem dey independent , to built state no dey di real deal , to dey command pipo witout respect , make di fascist leaders like Emma Powerful wey dey threaten to kil pipo don show already .
Ndigbo too posh to get leaders wey be thug and tout , wey no understand say Igbo political culture and framework na to dey consult elders .
Mr Nnamdi Kanu wey been dey command dem , no know any village for Igboland apart from hin own , dey claim to be dia leader like say na hin own , pipo wey be say he no know how dem dey live except for di moni wey hin dey send give dem from abroad .
Mr Emma """" di Powerful """" wey be dia media and publicity secretary don use hin arrogance and petty fascist inpunity spoil Igbo basic framework wey be say na to dey consult pipo and to dey agree for somethin generally before dey do am .
Na only organisation wey thug full dey threaten to destroy pipo wey no gree wit am .
But dis new threat wey Mr Emma """" de Powerful """" issue say he go send pipo go meet dia forefathers sake of say dem no follow am , don too much .
Sake of dat one reason , dey suppose find way restrict hin and hin pipo to avoid kasala
Onunaiju dey write from Abuja
Education for Nigeria don spoil finish bikos of di greed wey di leaders of association wey relate to am get
Old syllabus and way wey dem dey use teach na anoda kasala wey don add the ones wey dey ground .

Pipo like Joseph been call her Dark Continent
Since den , Africa no get any popular culture wey pipo know kom still accept apart from bloody , rooten and poor mindset wey reach to make one teenage band wey kom from America from di 80s feel say na dia moral duty to kos rain wey go stop di drought wey wan carry dem go by force .
Odawise she go die

Wu go know say Africa , togeda wit Nigeria go spoil so tey , dem go dey wait make some teenager wey no sure say dem no dia right from left dey give dem charity .
No be me
Shey Conrad correct ?
Shey na my duty to dey tok truth sake of say I dey honest , to wetin hin think say my pipo dey do
Shey make I fly go out like di rest of my dream ?
Maybe make I do am .
How we take reach der ?
We enta one car wey get engine , di sound good and e dey sleek , e kom life like Noah Ark as we dey go for 1960
We suppose dey rocket ship dey go Mars , instead na inside mud we sink put , for one Jalopy wey hin engine no good .
Before awa eye wey don dey gnash , di heart of darkness kom be my home , and my home kom be """" di oda world , """" di opposite of civilisation , place wia be say tin wey no reach man level dey yeye man intelligence wey dem dey use boast and dia grace .

how your athletes take cope with dia opponents wey get more experience
the task no dey easy unto say some states don go far as di USA , France and Germany to hire athletes
For FCT here , na government funding we depend on solely
state don give official money wey reach N15m make e go use am monitor proceedings for combat sports
na di money wey some states struggled get to attend the festival
for us , even before we go Benin city , minister don charge us make we dy responsible to ur behaviors and be worthy ambassadors
hin advised say make we no try win by all means
na him farewell message to us and we abided by it
we no go outside FCT go look for athletes
na dat exact thing we do
Luka Istifanus : FCT no go hire athletes make dem go win National Sports Festival medals
Di acting director in sports for FCT , Luka Istifanus don frown at di reckless poaching of athletes by di big money spenders as e don vow say di FCT no go waka about dey pay athletes to win National Sports Festival medals
For dis interview wey dem get wit Trust sports , di acting director don yarn on top di performance of team FCT for Edo 2020 and sports development for di Federal Capital Territory
How e dey go as you don resume office as di acting Director of Sports in di FCT ?
Di rate wey dem dey take smuggle no be small
Na me take over as di acting director of sports in di FCT on di 8th day of october 2020 and so tey dat time my major concern na how I go take sports for di Territory beyond wia I meet am
E no dey easy unto say FCT dey more or less civil service settlement
Una no fit compare am wit states like Lagos , Kano , Rivers , Edo , Kaduna and odas
Howeva , we dey do Evrithing wey go help improve di achievements wey we record for past
Interestingly , di Federal Capital Territory Administration don stand gidigba for awa back
FCT don placed 16th place on di medals table wey dem just conclude for di 2020 national sports festival
How satisfied you dey wit di performance of athletes
I suppose start my yarn to say na me be di happiest pesin wen di administration of di FCT approve say make we participate for di 2020 national sports festival
Although room still dey for improvement , I go say I dey satisfied wit wetin we achieve
As we dey look back , na we dey always be di 17th , 18th or 19th apart from wen we host sport festival for 2004 and 2018
una know say if una be di host you get advantage wey plenti
una fit patronise as many events as e possible
you fit register as many athletes wey you want
however , wen una dey go out una go cut down di number of events and athletes to minimise cost
I dey happy say dis time around , we no host but e end up for 16th position despite di enormous challenge wey we face
two states , di host Edo and Delta dey battle for supremacy and na dat dey impact negatively for officiating
we suppose perfom better but na officiating wey dey questionable deny us for plenti medals
no be only us be di victims of di supremacy tussle wey dey between Edo and Delta
in all , we dey grateful bikos we do better dan 21 states
wit di support of di goment , we go do better at Delta 2022
di national sports festival don dey open
how una athletes take cope wit dia opponents wey get more experience
the task no dey easy unto say some states don go far as di USA , France and Germany to hire athletes
as e dey for tennis , di player wey win di singles event na from France and dem pay am a sum of N5 million by Delta state
some states don buy so tey 30 proffessional for outside Kontri which be a whole lot money
Remember in adition to goment money , dem get oil companies wey be dem sponsors
For FCT here , na goment funding we depend on solely
one state don give official money wey reach N15m make e go use am monitor proceedings for combat sports
na di money wey some states struggled get to attend the festival
for us , even before we go Benin city , minister don charge us make we dey responsible to ur behaviors and be worthy ambassadors
hin advised say make we no try win by all means
na hin farewell message to us and we abided by it
we no go outside FCT go look for athletes
e don become di policy of di FCT to raise athletes and expose dem for national and international competitions
na dat exact thing we do
Pale una dey hear , abeg give us good pikin afta una don give us good pikin give us money wey we go use take care of dem
se una support calls in some quarters for di National Sports Festival make dem return am wen e suppose dey for amateurs strictly
no throw - way dis golden opportunity
di advantage wey big pass be say e dey make coach lazy
dem dey give coach salary but wen e reach sports festival time dem go give dem money wey dem go use go oda states go poach other athletes
i remember di 2018 edition , dem force some athletes make dem refund as much as N1m on top say dem fail to deliver medal for di states wey give dem contract
true true dis no help in di development of talents
Na so dem eliminate am
Na so dem deny oda players di opportunity wey go exhibit dia talent
Di sports festival don dey for di highest bidder but FCT no go buy medals
We no get money wey we go use take hire athlethes wey go win medals
We go kontinu dey raise local athletes wey be awa own
Pesin wey get God for hin side
True , true we suppose go back to di grassroots
Na 62 wards FCT get
Na evri council area get 10 words except AMAC wey get 12
Sports development suppose start from di ward level
For di past , FCT don organised so many competitions from di ward level but mostly dey team sports like football , handball , volleyball and athletics
Na events wey no dey capital intensive be dis
We dey always start from di wards to di area council headquarters and to di city centre
Na dis be di platform wey dey kontinue to dey generate athletes for di FCT
So i dey call oda states make dem emulate di FCT wen dem wan develop dia own athletes
As we dey tok of developing athletes , you fit tok say enough standard sporting facilities dey FCT ?
We get six sports centres wey dey under construction for each of di six area councils
Already , we don make one strong appeal and di hon
Minister of state , Dr Ramatu Tijani Aliyu don already go some of di facilities
She don go Kuje and AMAC and she dey dey plan to go to Bwari an odas go see di level of development
wit di backing of di honourable minister , Alhaji Musa Bello , she dey do Evrithing wey go make sure say dem complete diz facilities
We don also make request for sporting equipments for sports like Karate , Judo , Boxing , Wrestling and a host of odas
Na dey expect favourable responses
Na wetin be di plan for di next edition for di sports festival
We don already start training bikos di next edition no reach one year
We don start preparations and we make requests and recommendations wey go enable us prepare adequately for Delta 2022
We don invariably place di welfare for awa neighbours as awa own dey important
We need to dey imbibe di lessons of Ramadan
Need dey make dem pay more attention to di plights of di poor
Di Muslim month of self - purification and self - denial wey dem also know as Ramadan just end
As e dey last , di season wey dem dey use fast don offer all Muslims opportunity wey dem go use reflect on dia relationship wit Allah
E don also enable those wey get means to share food wit pipo wey poor , wey dey in need and pipo wey be less priviledged
For all Muslims , e be opportunity wey dem go use rededicate demsef to di teachings of di faith and di kos of mankind as a whole
Although e be period of deep reflection on di inter - relationship wey dey between man and hin neighbour , for di oda hand , as well as man and hin God
Even though di long - fasting don go , di lessons must endure
Ramadan get high spritual significance , na one of si five pillars of Islam be dat
To devotees , e be period of self - emptying witout which no spiritual being go get a truly rewarding relationship wit hin maker
Na dat explain why dem mark di exercise for Nigeria ( as elsewia in di world ) by private and group players , and abstinence from all forms of wordly comforts and pleasures
di aim Na to enhance spiritual growth and foster charity and brodaly love
As di Muslims don mark di end of dis annual spiritual exercise , dem dey hope say make di outkom go be of immense benefit di nation
Naija pipo can hardly make ends meet due to di economic situation wey dey prevail for di Kontri
As we dey pay attention to di plights of di poor , as dem amply demonstate am for di course of Ramadan we dey invariably place di welfare for awa neighbours say e dey important as awa own
As we dey allow odas partake for awa wealth or material possessions , we honour di one wey make us
Na dis be di heart of all religions but a virtue wey dey hard to imbibe by plenti pipo for Naija
E gast change
So tey di Ramadan fast , like di fawa pillars wey dey Islam , dem aim am at promoting both di spiritual and material well - being of man , e stand to reason say man dey invariable beta off s e dey do di will of God
Wen he dey able to rein in di impulse for self - gratification and greedy accumulation of wealth , man dey more liable to make hin society a better place wey pesin go live in , no be only hin but for hin neighbor also
Dat na one of di most enduring lessons of Ramadan wey we hope plenti pipo go imbibe
E dey noteworthy dat fasting as e be spiritual exercise dey advocated by all religions obstenibly wit di notion say di man wey fit make sacrifices for di bid to tame hin desires go be beta person for hinself and di society wey large
As one expert don put am say , besides abstention for food and drinks , fasting dey help di pesin wey dey faithful make e no dey look di provocative , make e no dey hear di mischievous , and make e no dey utter di obscene and make e dey avoid slander and make e no dey think about inflicting injury for odas
Di month of Rahmah ( blessing ) , barakah ( mercy ) and Magfirah dey upon us
Di blessed month na precious gift from Allah to muslims
But do we know why dis moth dey so special to muslims
Na wetin be di main koko for dis month , and all di blessings wey dey wit it
Na wetin be di lessons wey we suppose take away in observing , di sanctity wey dey dis month
Of course , dis month dey to train us , guide us , and to remind us of how we suppose approach di 11 months of di year wey remain
Ramadan dey teach us plenti lessons : how we go develop awa manners and moral fortitude , how we go treat awa fellow beings wit respect , how we go strenghten awa brodahood , how we go maintain unity wey dey di Muslim community , and how we go dey welkom di non - Muslims wey we dey share land togedir
Di month dey also tech us make we dey more pious , disciplined , and how we go maintain self - control , wen we dey shield awa souls from greed and immorality
But di main koko be say di month dey teach us how we fit improve awa connection wit di Almighty
Di month of Ramadan dey also instill sense of empathy wey dey inside us
E dey allow us to understand di situation of di less fortunate , make we feel and experience di pain of hunger and di pangs of thirst wey awa poverty - stricken brodas and sisters wey no get choice but to go witout food and drinks dey feel everi day wen dem wake
Ramadan na month of mercy and bonding Muslims wey dey all over di world dey help one anoda , and those wey dey dia community , make dem dey spread happiness all around
Dis month na shinny example for di unity wey we fit achieve among all classes of pipo wey dey any society as di rich and di poor , di employer as well as di employee ; di parents as well as di subjects , all dey fast
Regardless of di colour wey dem get for skin or dia social stature , na fasting dey unite all
E dey remind us how we suppose conduct awaselves and awa behaviour towards those wey dey around us while e dey also teach us di impotance of respect
No be to dey abstain from foods and drinks we learn , but we also abstain make we no go make statements and actions wey fit kos harm to pipo or violate rights wey dem get
E dey give us opportunity wey we go use rectify awaselves through performing plenti good deeds wey be like providing food or aid to di needy , improving social interaction , giving charity , sadaqah and zakat , and so on
Di Almighty go remember all di deeds wey do for judgement day
But wetin go apun to all di lesson wey we don learn afta Ramadan
Unfortuntely , we no too dey retain any of di lessons wey we learn for dis holy month pass Eid - Il - Fitr itself
But di koko for Ramadan run deep pass mere celebration
Di lessons wey we receive be di lodestar for di rest of di 11 months for any year wey dem give
Di training wey we receive suppose improve us as human beings fo di rest of awa lives , as dat na di main koko of Ramadan
Afta di month don end , and we don observe awa final fast , and dem don deal wit di Eid celebrations , we go go back to awa normal lives
But e dey important make we kip di spirit of Ramadan alive for di rest of di year , and indeed for awa live wey remain
bikos , na only through unity , modesty , and temperance we fit make di world a place wey beta for all of us
As we don tok evri evri , di nation leadres , political and odawise , get plenti wey dem go take from di lessons of Ramadan
If dem fit curtail deir materialistic tendencies and pay more attention to di yearnings fo di pipo , di Kontri go bikom a place much happier for Evribodi
We direfore dey urge awa leaders make dem imbibe lessons for Ramadan
To awa plenti Muslim readers we tok say , Eid Mubarak
Make Allah reward una sacrifice
Ibrahin Adbon dey write from Abeokuta , Ogun state
I neva open one page today
Column no 6 : who dey check checkpoint for Abuja
E dey go as dem dey tok am say Abuja , wey be di capital for awa dear Naija , dey important
So na me go be di last person wey go complain say security too much
In fact , I go even tok am say e need am more
Checkpoints , wey be di incredibly useful security constructs , don help and e still dey kontinue to help make e either thwart criminal , or even proactively tackle crime
Di police , wey dem saddle wit plenti of di internal security , at least for di ideal situation , man most of di checkpoints for Abuja Metropolis , as well as areas wey dey di surrounding
Sure , di army don pick up di slack for some places , but di boys supose be di main custodians
Dem vex for di pikin say dem do dat kain thing
Boy , dem dey mess things up for plenti cases
For starters , take for instance one of di checkpoints wey dey Wuse II , particularly di one wey dey lead from zone 4 treach Wuse II , just before e reach di bridge
di conduct of di officers for dere , for my experience , dey abysmal
anyone wey ply dat road afta 9pm
I no go enta details , but wetin I fit tok be say e dey extremely unprofessional sometimes
still for Wuse II , just beside di AP Plaza , di Tori na di same
I go lyk suggest to di higher - ups make dem monitor all di checkpoints wey dey Wuse II make dem see wetin I dey tok firsthand
but di checkpoints horror Tori no end for there
probably di one wey worst pass na di checkpoint wey dey afta di popular Banex junction wey dem dey man by cops wey dey from di Counter Terrorismm Unit ( CTU ) no less
barking at commuters and intimidating innocent citizens evri night , dem cut a picture of a poorly - trained and badly - behaved set of individuals wey seem to miss di point say dem suppose protect and serve citizens
na di same CTU dey responsible for di presonnel manning for one checkpoint wey dey near di Naija Farms And Ranch ( NAFARLS ) , wia all kain tinz dey unfold
anyone wey dey ply dat road fit see for demselves
I go also request make di higher - ups do di same , wit a view wey dem go use fix things
forget Abuja for one minute
look around Naija , and di plenti checkpoints roadblocks , really for highway across di Kontri by numerous security agencies , dem dey see am a reson for loss of time generally , or even for consumer goods and services
as di case be wit awa security organisations , dem dey always push back swiftly , wit well - oiled PR machines wey deny allegations or issuing veiled threats
no forget di fact say while plenti checkpoints fit be legal , plenti are not
dem make am clear by di way and manner in which di personnel mounting dey carry out dia activities
now , dis no be police - bashing piece
E no suppose disparge VIOs and FRSC personnel
E be general critique for checkpoints and how we dey do am for dis part of di world
which means we go look at odas , lyk di Federal Road Safety Corps ( FRSC ) and dat of VIOs
again , I no go yarn too much , just make I suggest closer monioring of di checkopints and checkpoints , really for some revelation dey shock
dis na bikos dis no be piece wey suppose disparge anyone or any organisation
but generally someone fit do something about di ridiculous lack of quality of awa checkpoints ?
checkpoints no be recent , e far as innovations go
dem be set standards for di various stypes wey exist , wetin we need do na to adhere to dem
dem dey quite helpful for fighting crime , we no fit wish dem away
But we owe to awaself to get dem right
like most things dem get di capacity for great good , but if to say dem handle am badly , e fit be source for plenti bad things
maybe if we focus on di one wey dey Abuja go help us , as best practices don dey spread nationwide
I no get interest in highlighting di bad , but di personnel wey dey di checkpoint dey make am inevitable
as all hope neva lost : I dey hope say somehow , someone , somewia wey fit do something about awa checkpoints go do something dem
dat someone , somewia , somehow , dey check awa checkpoints , and di pipo wey dey man dem
e fit make all di difference in awa safety and public perception about awa security personnel , wey be something we dey lack solely for a while now
time neva reach ?
we dey do things different - different
put am for rotation
Glut don jam Katsina tomato farmers
Farmers and dealers of tomatoes for Katsina state don experince for di past two weeks acute market glut ; some don resort to dey sun - dry di produce
according to di farrmers , dem no dey expect dat kain development , considering di stiff economic condition wey dey di Kontri , high cost and demand for food items , as well as longtime border closure wey halt free importation of food items wey include tomato paste
Shehu Bashiru Danja , wey be tomato farmer yarn say dem dey expect huge revenue for dis period but dem dash deir hope wit di recent development
plenti of us don target christmas and New year period , wit di hope say we go make good sales or di produce , but e shock us say we go end up for market glut
hin tok say e really affect us bikos of di high cost of production wey involve fertiliser , seeds , herbicides / pesticides and labor
Bahiru kom add say since di closure for land borders and di outbreak of COVID - 19 , di market price for tomato no less pass N1 , 000 for one basket until recently
hin kom add for last year say dem sell one big basket of tomatoes between N3 , 000 and N10 , 00 , one reason wey many irrigation farmers dis season go concentrate on tomato production , and dem dey hope say e go yield huge profits pass crops like wheat , irish potato , or cabbage
Hamza Dalhatu , wey be tomato merchant and farmer yarn say dem borne di market glut out of protest against di indiscriminate taxes and levies wey dem put for di produce for Southern market
so tey last year , increase don dey in taxes and levies on awa goods and trucks wey dey di southern part for di Kontri
di security issue wey dey linger be threats to awa merchants ; na so dem suspend business till dem sort out things
we no fit kontinue lyk dat
Dalhatu tok say , all di cost burden go end up on farmers wey no go consider di cost of production .
one check for Danja and Funtua market don reveal say one small basket of tomatoes cost N400 wen one big basket no pass N1 , 200
so tey last week Friday
anoda tomato dealer , Sani Suleiman Hunkuyi , don express hope say things go soon normal as dealers for Lagos and Ibadan don visit some of dia members wey dey Sokoto , Kebbi , and Zamfara make dem fashion out new terms for di business
di market glut for di produce be temporary and farmers go soon kontinue dey reap I maximum benefits for dem sweat
Suleiman tok say / Suleiman yarn say
Also , Umar Isah , wey be an agric based Katsina yarn say market glut no be beta thing to pipo wey dey produce Tomato and Onion , and e go kontinue unless dem produce modern storage and and processing facilities , no be only by di goverment but agricultural companies and entrepreneurs
di only way be say make dem establish local storage and processing facilities wey dem go use produce zone across di Kontri
hin yarn say , make agric companies and entrepreneurs take dis challenge as soon as possible take use solve di long time problem
Nana na di last pesin wey commot di room

Sergeant Adegoke Ajibola and Corporal Rotimi Oladele run as fast as deir legs fit carry , seek for place wey dem go hide , pleaded for deir lives as di mob close on dem
all dia pleas go fall on deaf ears
dem drag dem , beat dem , hit dem wit sticks , knives and any objects wey dey available for sight

according to di official record and findings by awa correspondence , Ajibola and Oladele no be members of di SARS wey dem just disband
in fact dem no be regular policemen wey dem dey see for road as finding don reveal say dem dey attached to di operation department for Oyo state police command
di area wey dem dey engage dey usually be for special duty as different companies and organisations de request , and as e dey approved by di command
dem dey dia way for dat engagement for one fish depot for di Wema Bank area wey dey Gbagi for Ibadan wen dem meet dia untimely death
coincidentally , Ajibola wey be 41 year - old and hin colleague , Oladele , get three pikin each
Oladele's wife , Feranmi , just born dia third pikin 16 days before di unfortunate incident
Feranmi , wey be di orphan , just as her husband wey late , tok say di news of hin death shattered her world
tears well up for her eyes as she dey recount di experience of six months ago wey dey horrifying
sensing danger as di EndSARS protest don dey tun violent for some areas , Feranmi don plead make Oladele stay for house

Abiodun Alade and Eugene Agha for Lagos , Jeremiah Oke for Ibadan and Idowu Samotu for Abuja
Explosion dey for around dat ikeja and e kill some pipo
Dem dey develop Naija's gas for di domestic market
di natural gas na one cultured industry wey dey drive innovation and e dey touch nearly Evri field and aspect of life wey we care about
from mobile phones to di makeup wey we dey wear , to medical devices , bank cards , and even di football wey e dey kick around wit friends
Di industry na one of di building blocks of di things wey we need and love evri day
dem dey use natural gas for transportation , cooking , electricity generation and manufacturing
Dem dey use am as raw material wey dem dey use make ferterlizer , antifreeze , plastics , pharmaceuticals and fabrics
Di steel and paper industry dey also us e natural gas to generate process steam wey dem dey use for industrial applications
Data wey dey for ground don show say Africa's largest economy , Naija , get di largest natural gas reserves for di continent
wit oil , di industry go account for about 70 per cent of its revenue , e go make di sector one of Naija's best and most sought - afta employment sectors
plenti of Naija's electricity generation na from natural gas , while dem dey use di crude oil for power backup
one forecast wey di U . S Energy Information Administration do don show say dat natural gas go be di largest elcetricity generation source
Natural - gas dem bring its sevaral quality - of - life environmental benefits bikos e dey relatively clean burning - fuel
Globally , di sector dey dey produce millions of jobs , , wit employment wey dey up to 40 per cent so tey di Great Reccession of 008 for di U . S alone
Thus , given di gas reserves wey dey exist , e shock to see say Naija no dey lead di continent gas industry
President Buhari don launch di kontri's decade of gas , for 29th of March 2021
Di aim na to transform Naija into a gas - powered industrialised economy by 2030
Developing di gas industry go boost oda industries through di provsion of electricity and raw materials
Here , we go shine light on three points : some gas development policies wey dey critical , di potential benefits of developing di gas industry for di domestic market , and di employent opportunities wey dey gas industry
So tey di discovery of gas for Naija , subsequent attempts to develop di industry
For example , di gas commercialisation and utilisation programmes contributed to reduce gas flaring and increase gas utilisation by about 300 per cent between 1995 and 2017
there be gas pipeline projects wey concentrate on di western part of di kontri and di continent
Dem commissioned di first Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System for 1989 to supply lagos and neighboring south - west states
Afta di success of di ELPS , di goverment agree make dem dey supply Ghana , Benin and Togo through di Western African Gas Pipeline wey dem commission for 2016
Howeva , dis project no dey favourable to di kontri's domestic market , given di persistent issues for power wey dey di kontri
Evidently , Naija's power sector dey challenged wit electricity facilities wey poor , shortage for natural gas supply , distribution network wey dey inefficient and transmission system wey dey inadequate
Accordig to di 2018 estimate wey di International Energy Agency do , na only 60 per cent of Naija dey use natural gas
population get access to electricity
power shortage don limit di growth for di Kontri's total population for all sectors
E don kos make plenti business close or move completely to neighboring kontries
E dey challenge new start - ups and attract foreign investment
Di lack of electricity don contribute to di high rate of inflation as business don dey pay for expensive alternative electricity source , dia production cost don increase , and e dey increase di price of goods and services
To mitigate diz issue , di Buhari administration don commision gas infrastructure project make dem promote use of gas for domestic market
Di projects include di second Escravos to Lagos Pipeline System ( ELPS - 2 ) Obiafu Obriko
Oben ( OB3 ) gas line and di Ajaokuta to Kaduna to Kano ( AKK ) gas line
Di AKK gas line project go pass through Abuja from Ajaokuta
Den we go see anoda line from Abuja to Kaduna , , den from Kaduna to Zaria , and from Zaria to Kano
wit hindight , dem suppose do dis projects since di turn of di millenium
Nonetheless , dem be notable projects and dem suppose praise dem wit optimism
Dem expect make di project guarantee net investment return
Di gas line go provide gas to cement firms , and residential customers
Di users of compressed natural gas like buses and trucks go dey able to buy di product cheaper as di supply don increase
Di governmet dey also plan to build three new gas - fired power plants for power generation plants wey dem fit locate for Abuja , Kaduna , and Kano , make dem use di pipelines gas to generate 3 , 600 MW power
Di power plant go provide electricity for households and many industries wey dey di Northern part of di kontri
Di benefit for producing a decent amount of power and raw materials from gas go born one success tori
For example , if dem resuscitate di textile industry e go mean say dem dey revive di largest manufacturing sub - sector , wey account for 22 per cent of employment and 15 per cent of manufacturing value - added for 1984
in di long run , di tax revenue for di performing industries and employees go outweigh di cost of pipeline projects
If to say goverment policies dey successful , all oda things as e dey equal , di natural gas industry go be one major source of job opportunities for Naija's labour force wey dey rise
Di industry get high concentration of contractors and sub - contractors , wit different splits wey dey between specialists
Dem characterise di industry as semi - skiled and skiled crafts trades positions
Demmno restrict jobs wey dey di sector to petrolrum engineers alone
plenti roles no need special education
Di skil na something e fit learn on di job , from attorneys to welders to architects , truck drivers and accountants
Di industry dey also pay minimum wage
E mean say di industry get enormous opprtunity to attract , retain , and developlifelong careers for individuals as di industry dey expand
To dey find job for di industry dey similar to oda sophisticated , high - tech industries
Employees suppose get decent education , some certification as industry specialist go be an advantage , training and experince go go far
therefore , as di goverment dey lay out policies for di Decade of Gas , , di opportunity for capacity development go open
Di education sector fit explore di training curriculum wey dey for di industry and ways wey dem go take use attract industry experts wey go contribute to capacity development
In conclusion , di decade for Gas na desirable policy
E be opportunity for Naija wey dem go use to develop di gas industry , even as e dey look a bit too late for dis administration
Thus , di goment wey next and all di relevant stakeholders suppose consider dis ingenuity wey dem go use transform di kontri to a gas - powered industrialised economy

Kidnapping : Abuja suburb dey request for police division

As di demand for rabbit don dey increase , frmers dey explain say make di youths key in for dis kain of farming
Rabbit farming no common for Naija but di demand for rabbit meat dey grow as e be for kontries like Europe and Asia
Acoording to wetin di Food and Agriculture Organisation of di United Nations ( FAO ) don estimate say dem dey slaughter 1 . 2 billion rabbits annually for meat
Di South African National Agricultural Marketing Council for June 2020 don reveal say 1 . 48 million tons of rabbit meat were produced in 2017 .
China wey be di leading producer dey acount for 62 . 9 % of di production wey dey global , followed by followed by North Korea ( 10 . 4 % ) , Spain ( 3 . 9 % ) and Egypt ( 3 . 8 % ) , among odas
As 2019 dey end , Hungary , China , France and Spain dey among di major contributors to di trade balance for rabbit meat by value globally
According to wetin statistic say . Germany , Belgium and Italy na di leading importers as dem dey command 21 % , 19 . 2 % and 9 . 3 % share of global imports respectively
For Naija here , one far , Wise Trust Intl Ltd dey change di narrative amidst huge and rising demand for rabbit meat and breeding stock for di kontri
Pastor Tayo Ayinla wey white meat dey drive hin passion tok am say hin first motivation for di rabbit business na di health benefit bikos pipo wey dey hin age suppose cut down di consumption of red meat and waka dey chop white meat hin kom add say di motivation further led to di discovery of its economic benefits .
Na di pastor get di biggest rabbit farm for di Federal Capital Territory
Hin get 17 species of rabbit on top di farm wey hin start like say a year ago for Karshi , for Abuja Municipal Area Council .
Hin dey raise dem for cage , hutches wey dem construct locally and in free range
Dis reporter wey dey Karshi , visit di farm wia di pastor kom share hin knowledge of rabbit farming so odas fit tap into am
Hin also get rabbits for anoda farm for Kwara state
Some of di free range rabbit for di farm
How rabbits dey multiply
Hin say if di farmer get about 60 to 70 doe ( na di female rabbit dem dey call doe and di male buck ) wit an average of five births per rabbit , hin go get very good number per year .
For instance , on dis farm , we don see a doe wey born 10 to 11 rabbits
But I wan dey more conservative
So make we say five rabbits as an average : di one rabbit fit give farmer between 25 to 30 rabbits for a year bikos wen good management dey dem fit produce four to six times for one year
So if to say hin get five for one year dat mean say hin get 25
Multiply am by di 60 wey we dey tok about e make 1 , 600 rabbits for one year
Of kos , una fit get pass dat
pipo dey demand for rabbit meat
Di demand for rabbit meat dey grow and according to wetin Pastor Ayinla say , dem neva meet di demand fully
Hin tell di reporter say hin receive order of 10 tons of rabbit meat for di Southwest but e dey very difficult to get even one ton
At some time una go get perosn wey go dey request for 2 , 500 rabbits say hin wan breed am but hin go get up 500
One time dey wey we get request of 2 , 500 rabbits for breeding stock for di whole of di North ( di client organisation get Northern representative for Abuja here ) , but for di whole of di North , we dey only supply a little above 200 out of di order wey dem place for 2 , 500 .
So rabbitry na upkoming ATM moni dispenser
Hin say very soon e go turn moni dispencing business
Di rabbit value chain don boom
Di farmer explain for di rabbit value chain say : most of us no know di benefits wey we get for rabbit rearing
Number one be say , plenti value dey for rabbit farming
As a farmer una fit make moni from selling di rabbits breding stock to anoda farmer ; una fit sell rabbit meat to those wey want am ; una fit get income through di sale of dia poo or from di conversion of dia poo into gas for cooking , or generation of electricity and wetin remain of dat process fit be used as fertiliser .
Most pipo dey use rabbit wastes for fertiliser but e no dey as effective as wen una dey pass di poo for some process
Also , dem fit use di urine as pesticide for di production of vegetables
Cost wey dem dey take use start rabbit farm no dey expensive
wit just N25 , 000 to N30 , 000 farmer fit start rabbit farming
Di good thing be say anybodi fit do am ; an old person fit do am bikos of di management dey very easy
Una no need one particular place to do rabbit farming bikos dem be neat animals , dem no dey smell
Actually una fit do am for una house even for person wey get two - bedroom flat
For instance , una fit convert one of di room
Dem no dey smell
Di farmers dey always kom buy from us ; we dey assist dem set up dia farms
And as I tok am , for awa own little way , we start am about a year ago
Rabbit feed no dey expensive
Di thing wey good about rabbits be say dia feeding no dey demand , dem just dey chop anything
For instance , as we dey handle am here , we dey usually go meet pipo wey dey sell cabbage and collect di outer cover of di cabbage , e dey okay for dem
Also for di person wey dey sell watermelons , pipo dey usually chop di red part throw - way di cover
Di cover dey medicinal to dem
Also , we dey go market wey dem dey sell carrots go pick di leaves
Virtually wetin rabbit dey chop na almost free , and e dey get much easier
wen di rain start den we fit get plenti fresh leaves for dem
One word for di youths be say make dem work hard
My advice for di youths be say make dem understand say di goverment no fit meet all of awa needs
Di reason why we dey get some kain kwanta be say plenti pipo want make goverment jobs
First and foremost , una need look inward : wetin I fit do for myself
Until una fit do something for unaself una no fit do anything for di kontri
Una suppose understand say lots of opportunity dey as dis kontri is concerned
Some pipo go tell you say dem wan do dis and dat
Egun pipo speak beta pass una
But market no dey
So di question na : how una go dey kontri wey get pass 200 million pipo kom dey tok say money no dey
Una dey tok say market no dey
Na either una no understand how dem dey market wetin una dey do
Abi una no know how dem dey do business
Like for rabbit , if una see how awa rabbits be , di business go attract you , dem dey look so robust
So pipo dey say I neva see rabbit wey big like dis
Dis na di way we dey take use manage dem in terms of wetin we feed dem and di environment wey we create for dem
So pipo go begin dey look inwards
Una fit sell rabbit meat to those wey want am ; una fit get income through di sale of dia poo or from di conversion of dia poo into gas wey dem dey use cook or generate electricity and wetin dey ground of dat left of di process wey dem fit use as fertiliser
Na only e - voting go ensure rancour say free polls dey for Naija - Diri
Senator Duoye Diri wey be di Bayelsa state governor tok say di hitch - free conduct of di Ijaw National Congress ( INC ) election wey dem do through electronic voting don indicate say Naija fit hold rancour - free national elections if dem adopt dat kain measure
Diri don tok am for di inauguration of di new INC leadership at di Ijaw house for Yenagoa , as hin urge di Independent National Electoral Commission ( INEC ) make dem adopt electronic voting wey go help dem avoid conflicts during elections .
Hin note am say di failure of di electoral bodi of di kontri make dem adopt e - voting don lead to politicisation of reversed state institutions and disrespect to such institutions .
Di governor don explain say di adoption go provide opportunity for Naija pipo wey dey di Diaspora choose dia leaders through di ballot .
Hin say : I be advocate and supporter of electronic voting system
Dem don deny plenti Naija pipo di right wey go make dem vote bikos dem no dey Naija and dem no fit participate in choosing dia leaders
Na challenge for Naija e be
Make e challenge di Independent National Electoral Commission
If di Ijaws fit do am , di Federal goverment fit do am also
If Ijaws fit enfranchise Ijaws wey dey Europe and America make dem be part of deciding who go lead dem , INEC fit do am
Hin tok say e go check violence , criminality and state institutions being politicised
For hin inaugural lecture , di new INEC president , Professor Benjamin Okaba asuure dem say di bodi go work for di progress of Ijaw pople
Prof . Okaba note am say INEC go fully support di recent pronouncement by governors of south Naija wey dey prohibit open grazing for di region , hin still tok say di organisation go provide necessary support wey go ensure say dem adhere to di laws wey dem aim at protecting di pipo and dia land against invasion from external forces .
Hin say di INC go collaborate wit oda ethnic minorities wey dey share di same experience wit di Ijaws make dem achieve dia dreams , say di ethnic group no dey aware of surreptitious moves wey some groups dey make to annex territories for di Niger Delta so tey di resources wey e get , but say no part of Ijaw would be ceded or conquered .
Jide like to dey do yanga wen hin don get new toy
Maize farmers don raise alarm say maize go dey scarce for 2021

Pastor Adefarasin ; if Nigeria na scam ; den all of us na scammers
Na di compulsory duty of everi citizen to hold di government to account .
In fact , citizenship na call to duty for di state .
And no compulsory duty wey pass make citizens dey scrutinize and monitor dia employees """" di government """" frequently .
Criticising di government na part of di rights of everi citizen , and active citizenship get to do wit takin di governmentthroughe pace .
No government wey dem no dey criticise , and no government too special for pipo to criticise .
But , we need differentiate between any government and Nigeria as a kontri .
Government go kom and go , but Nigeria go remain .
We need understand say Nigeria na di pipo wey dey inside .
So , wen we belittle di kontri , we just dey shoot awasef for leg .
If we tok say Nigeria na scam , indirectly wetin we mean be say , Nigerians be scammers .
Nigeria no be scam , like som of dose wey dey abuse di nation dey always tok , unknowingly ; Na we turn Nigeria to anytin wey e be .
Nigeria no be just a place somwia .
Nigeria na di pipo .
Di gud , di bad and di ugly """" na we make am be laidat .
Anytin wey dey affect di kontri , na we be di agent wey cause am .
If Nigeria na scam as Pastor Paul Adefarasin tok , den we all be scammers .
Even say I agree , say Adefarasin anger na becos of di love wey e get for di kontri , im comment say Nigeria na scam and fraud no dey reasonable .
If Nigeria na fraud ; den all of us be fraudster , leaders and followers join .
All of us don contribute to di dissapointment of di entity .
We dey live for a kontri wia pastors dey run dia ministry like business .
Dem dey run am like business enterprise but dem no dey pay tax for dere .
CAMA ; Government introduce a law wey go regulate di business undertaking of di religious industry and wey go bring som transparency and accountability inside di spiritual business .
But na pastors dey against dis law pass .
Still , na dis same pipo wey no wan follow di law be di loudest voice wen dem dey pass capital sentence on Nigeria .
Funny tin be say , dis pastors dey follow di law of oda kontri dey run dia church for dose kontri .
Dem dey submit dia finance for regular check by di authorities for UK , US and oda places .
But for Nigeria dem dey live above di law .
Pastor Chris Oyakhilome don dey spread harmful lies about COVID vaccine .
E claim say na di concoction of di anti - Christ .
Dem fine am 125 , 000 pounds for Uk , sake of say e dey tok harmful and unsubstantiated tins about di vaccine .
But for Nigeria wia e dey kontinue to bring different COVID conspiracy , dem neva call am to kom explain im offence , sake of say na man of god e be .
Maybe na why Nigeria be scam .
If Nigeria na scam , den na becos of pastors wey dey siddun for top , kom dey step on di law wey dey govern di land .
If Nigeria na fraud , den na becos of pastors wey dey sign agreement wit politicians everi election period ; dey campaign for dem on di altar , dey command di demons of hell untop dose wey no gree accept dia anointed candidate .
Clergymen dey as corrupt as di politikal class .
Also , civil servant , wey dey collect N150 , 000 per month , but get pikin for UK school , and property for all ova di major cities of di kontri , go abuse Nigeria and carry all im hypocrisy put for lamentation and insult to di state .
E go calm down ignore e own contribution for di corruption wey dey destroy di kontri .
Also , som citizens dey reject laws , rules and regulations .
Wia traffic light dey , dem go ignore am ; wia protocol dey , dem go bypass am , and for places wia dem don get standard for gud service delivery and operations , dem go abandon am .
Still , all of dem go blame Nigeria for di bad status quo as if say di kontri dey exist witout di pipo .
Di problem wey Nigeria get na pipo problem .
But di bad tin be say nobodi wan take responsibility for di terrible way wey tins be .
We dey blame di Nigeria wey no exist .
Na all of us get hand for inside di bad situation of Nigeria .
Instead make we dey follow di tin wey we don conclude about Nigeria , make we forsee goodness and positivity into di system , and make we dey work to make awa kontri di tin wey we want make e be .
Nigeria go be wetin we want make e be .
Di politicians get comma .
But dat na di reason why new generation of leaders must come up and take kontrol .
Nobodi fit free awa mind except us .
Citizenship na call to duty .
NIGERIA NO BE SCAM .
Why separation no be di Silver Bullet to Nigeria challenges
Di principle of self - determination as e dey for di UN charter wey awa pipo wey wan separate hold - on to , take effect for a time wey many pipo for di world dey under colonial yoke or oda form of kontrol by outside power .
Di principle na to give chance to independence and liberation movements so dem go fit gain dia freedom and determine dia path of future development .
For di world wey we dey today , dis principle only apply to few pipo , becos majority of di world don dey free from colonial kontrol and sef - governing .
So dem go need adjust di principle of sef - determination , wey dem establish under di UN charter , so e go fit accommodate di demand of awa pipo wey wan separate , becos if we follow wetin dey dere , dem no qualify .
First of all , dem go need to prove carefully and convincingly say di area wey dem claim to represent dey under som form of kontrol , and say dem dey lack di basic freedom wey everibodi suppose enjoy as e dey di UN charter .
And for wia dem wan prove dat one , dem go need convince di UN on di steps wey dem don take , from di national ( National Assembly ) , sub - regional ( ECOWAS ) and continental level ( AU ) to present dia case .
And di UN no go just take dia word laidat .
Dem go get committee wey go confam di fact to know weda true - true , Nigeria as a kontri dey practise di basic requirement of demokracy or not .
Dem don even complicate di case wit di fact say dose areas no be area wey dem dey fight untop , and no be area wey dey under any trusteeship wey go need UN referendum to give dem direct independence or ask dem who dem wan join inside di pipo wey dey fight untop di place .
If our secessionists cannot provide these basic requirements , the farthest their case could get within the UN system will predictably be the waste paper basket because the UN is not for frivolities .
E no dey give chance make som movement wey no know wetin dem dey about abuse im wide and transparent process .
Di case of marginalisation , wey dem mention as part of di reason for separation , dey too simple to waste awa time untop .
Na everi democratik system dey get winner and loser for election .
And as awa politikal system no perfect reach , di konstitution make am compulsory say as many ethnic group and geo - political zones as possible must get representative for government and im institutions .
E go tough for di pipo wey wan separate to convince di outside world say dia case of marginalisation dey more compelling pass dat of more dan 300 oda ethnic group wey dey Nigeria .
Wetin dis one mean be say , why di international community , wey di pipo wey wan separate dey report and seek support from go single out jus two out of like hundred of dat kind case wey dey ring for di Nigerian media say na im dem go work on ?
What makes their cases so special and urgent above those of others in Nigeria who have conversely chosen not to follow the path of secession ?
Out of all di three tins wey make awa secessionists dey agitate , no one dey convincing or compelling enough to justify dia action .
On di amalgamation argument , Nigeria own no be special case for Afrika or for di world .
If Nigeria go need break up unto say Britain no join am well , den dis go be di case of almost all di kontris for Afrika .
In short , if dem use dis principle , e go start di course to begin a new scramble for Africa by di old and upcoming world powers , and like befor , na Afrikans go be di victim .
Make we no deceive awasef , becos if di break - up of Nigeria happun ( God forbid ) , e go lead to di birth of kontris
wey go dey weak sotey , dem go dey beg from di foreign powers .
We don get som argument wey dey compare di break up of Nigeria wit dat of Eastern European states and di Balkans .
Untop dis one , e go beta make we undastand well say di tin wey work for Europe fit no work for Africa .
In di case of di kontris wey we mention , na part of di great geo - strategic games of di major world powers wey get direct cultural , economik and politikal link and interest for di emerging scenario .
And dis kontris don get clear boundary befor dem agree to kom togeda for mutual defence durin di uncertain situation of di Second World War .
Immediately di Soviet order , wey join dem togeda begin dey scatter , all dis kontris need go back to di status quo ante .
And , more importantly , dis developments get di backing and guarantee of di important powers for Europe and di world .
Se Nigerian secessionists get dat kind recognition and profile in di face of di principal powers of di world wey go make dem answer dem ?
Surely , di answer na zero .
Dis no kom mean say di agitation of pipo to separate for di kontri no get som gud reason .
Anybodi wey dey live for dis kontri wit dis rising case of insecurity , poverty , corruption , nepotism , economic uncertainty and di unbelievable incompetence and near criminal indifference of di government to dis challenges go conclude say truly , we dey for a kontri wey dey fail for im basic konstitutional duties and responsibilities .
And for a fragile kontri like awa own , wey get plenti fault , e dey normal for tendency or preference for separation to arise and grow fast wit di clear dysfunctionality of di government wey dey .
And na everybodi get dis dis feeling .
But as discouragin as di outlook be , and as temptin as di outcome dey appear , separation no fit be di solution to awa current challenge as a nation .
Indeed na prospect wey get som unknown dangers , danger wey no be for di secessionists alone but for di kontri as a whole .
Nigeria no dey perfect .
Even som of di advance kontris don show say despite dia years of existence and dia gud systems , dem no dey free from crises wey dey kom from internal conflict .
Make we no dey deceive awasef say as we dey try break up awa kontri , som kontris go graciously assist us .
Wetin dem go do na to give us di means to destroy and weaken awasef , so dem go fit benefit while we go suffer am .
Na di truth about di international system be dat .
As di popular German beamter tok for di beginnin of my paper ; Na we be awa own problem and solution join togeda .
We need put awa mind , talent and effort togeda to develop Nigeria instead say we wan breaking am .

Investin in young pipo : Ahmed Bobboi example
For July , 2017 , I get di honour to spend one evenin inside one British bank wey dem dey call Coutts , as part of di plenti activity wey dey for us as di 2017 Queen's Young Leaders .
U fit dey wonder say why I go dey write about event wey I go for place wey dry like bank .
Anyway , Coutts no be ordinary bank .
Apart from say na one of di eight oldest bank for di world ( dem start am som 329 years ago for 1692 ) , Coutts na private bank wey dey popular for im big customers like Her Majesty di Queen .
Inside di big hall , na two welcome us under a big dome for di centre of di building .
Na sharp - sharp I recognise one of di two men wey stand wit a familiar wide smile .
Na Sir John Major , befor - befor British Prime Minister and Chairman of di Queen Elizabeth Diamond Jubilee Trust .
We don meet befor , for one dinner wey dem organize for us for di Australian High Commission wey dey London , and na dere e congratulate us for awa recognition by Her Majesty .
Dem introduce di oda man to us as Lord William Waldegrave of North Hill .
Na im be di Chairman of di Board of Coutts Bank and Chairman of di Royal Mint Advisory Committee .
Dat evening dey full of entertainment ; eatin and drinkin .
E sweet well - well
But apart from di display and glamour , we tok and gist wit Lord Waldegarve and Sir Major , two outstandin leaders for di United Kingdom ( UK ) .
Dem show dia happiness to celebrate awa achievement , and dem describe us as special pipo .
Dem encourage us to develop awa skills more and create long legacy for awa kontri and di Commonwealth togeda .
Afta , I follow Sir Major and Lord Wadegrave yarn for private , I ask dem som question about public service , banking and finance , innovation and young pipo generally .
I learn a lot of tins from dem
and I komot for Coutts .
Dat night seriously inspire and motivate me more as a change agent , innovator and young leader for Nigeria .
Weda u dey for government , or u dey business , and especially as innovator or entrepreneur , I no fit tok am finish , how important dis kind inspiration fit be for di work wey u dey do .
Som pipo fit komot face for dis confirmation say e no dey relevant .
Dem don forget how dis kind tok fit be beta way of mentorship and motivation for upcomin leaders , and e fit serve as example for dem to see champions among pipo wey be like dem .
Di feeling of validation and motivation , wit guidance and support na necessary ingredient for everi leader , especially young pipo .
Di earlier awa older generation for Nigeria realise and accept dis culture of support and mentorship wit dia full chest , and truly celebrate awa achievements , di beta e go be for di future of dis kontri and di growin population of young pipo .
Make u forgive my digression .
Di reason why I dey narrate dis experience na say , since wey e don happun , I no experience dat kind tin again , until recently wen I siddun wit anoda public servant for Nigeria , di Executive Secretary of di Petroleum Equalisation Fund
( Management ) Board ( PEF - M - B ) , Alhaji Ahmed A Bobboi .
Even say oil and gas no be my main industry of discipline or practice , I get strong opinion say make pesin no sabi am dey very careless since di contribution of di sector to revenue
pass any oda sector for di kontri .
So I don dey try sabi wetin dey happun for di industry , even say I want make we shift and focus on non - oil sources of income .
I dey happy say I get di opportunity to yarn wit a crucial stakeholder like di executive , especially becos di organisation na pacesetter for di use of advance technology to improve efficiency and performance for di sector .
Howeva , wetin I gain from dis experience even dey more valuable pass my understanding of di industry more .
We discuss difrent topic ; from history to government , and from job creation to innovation and entrepreneurship .
E dey very excitin and refreshin , and e carry me straight go Coutts again .
I meet Mr Bobboi for di first time wen I join one team wey e follow kontrol , we dey work untop one regional entrepreneurship acceleration programme under di supervision of Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) wia different community for di world join MIT for evidence - based practical approach to make di entrepreneurial ecosystems strongthroughinnovation .
I dey suprised by di vision and dedication wey dis go bring for PEF - M - B to dey involve for dis project , as e surely dey visionary and more beneficial to help build a formidable entrepreneurial ecosystem wit partner like MIT pass di ordinary Corporate Social Responsibility ( CSR ) programme wey most organization dey do , wey no dey get impact most times .
For dat particular encounter wey I get wit am , we yarn about awa two - years programme wit MIT and di big responsibility of truly acceleratin entrepreneurial development as remedy to lack of jobs and catalyst for prosperity .
The He spoke about various pain points for him as a leader and the approach to solve them .
One of di wonderful takeaway wey I collect na im idea about di National Youth Service Corps ( NYSC ) and how we fit use am serve young graduates and di nation beta .
Becos e don dey notice say som corps members wey dey serve for PEF - M - B dey always dey idle , di executive secretary tok say e don dey find way to ensure say di corp members no just dey engaged , but say dem komot wit skills and knowledge wey go last , and wey go give dem career wey pass government job .
Part of dis go be to do one big programme wey go turn dem to entrepreneurs wey get passion for innovation , througha dedicated and well planned innovation and enterprise trainin durin dia service year for PEF - MB .
Di honesty and sincere disposition of Mr . Bobboi dey visible and penetrating truout awa discussion and me sef kom get di strong will to do my best , no be only to kontinue dey innovate for different sector but to also dey ensure kontinuity for di inspiration and support of younger leaders and innovators , wey go fit make all di difference for awa dear kontri Nigeria .

Rice sufficiency : Nigeria get long way to go Expert
Dr Philip Idinoba , wey be rice commodity specialist for AfricaRice , don show im consign untop di increasin population wey dey affect Federal Government effort to boost rice production .
Idinoba yarn dis one for interview wit News Agency of Nigeria ( NAN ) for Gombe on Tuesday .
E tok say government need to invest more on rice , so e go fit boost Nigeria food security .
As e yarn , di government dey do plenti tins to boost rice production , sake of say na staple food , but di growin population of di kontri dey bring down di effort .
E tok say di rate of urbanisation , wey be one of di key factors of rice consumption for Nigeria , dey veri high pass di rate wey we take dey use plant rice .
Nigeria still get long way to go for rice sufficiency .
We dey make effort everi yearthroughdi Anchor Borrowers Programme , special intervention programme and oda donor funded projects .
All dis na to bring som tins wey go help farmers increase dia yield and productivity .
But even wit all dis Federal Government effort , di numba of new mouth wey dey join evri year cancel all dis improvement .
Idinoba yarn .
Plenti tins to do
Di agronomist add am join say we need to do plenti tins by increasin awa investment , especially for dry season farmin .
As Idinoba tok , we fit take advantage of dry season farmin to boost rice productivity .
We go get beta result for rice production if we fit close di gaps wey dry season dey always cancel for rice cultivation .
E yarn say , if u get eight million farmers wey dey plant rice for wet season , and only two million out of dem dey plant rice for dry season , den di effort never reach yet .

JVC of Bauchi dey di Division 1 league , and dem go collect promotion enta next season premier league , unto say na dere di big guns dey , and na wetin we dey aim for be dat .

Wetin Kano need for 2023
Kano need create new path to development for 2023 .
Dis na becos di state don dey enta di pit of poverty .
Awa rich pre - colonial history show say na Kano rich pass for all di Hausa states , becos di state dey involve for di economy .
Even say di colonialists destroy di economic foundation of Kano and oda society wey dem colonise , di policy of di pipo wey lead di Native Authority from 1926 to 1963 contribute to make Kano remain as di leadin economic centre of Northern Nigeria .
For example , dem establish di first modern water treatment plant wey dey di region for 1931 , di first independent power plant for Northern Nigeria , wey get 15MW , and for more dan 80 years , dem neva establish any one wey resemble am for Northern Nigeria .
Dem establish di first industrial estate wey dey di Northern Region , dem inherit only one primary school for 1926 , and for 1963 everi village don get primary school ( more dan hundred ) , dem establish secondary schools , dem no meet any hospital ( except one dispensary ) and for 1963 dem don build two general hospital and more dan hundred dispensaries for everi village .
Na dem lay di foundation of modern Kano .
Politikally , na dem make di NPC becom di rulin party for Nigeria .
From 1966 to 1979 and 1984 to 1999 , Kano still maintain im position as di second to Lagos .
Kano no get kontrol ova macro - economic policy but e leaders fit provide di right environment for economic growth .
For example , di Dawanau Market , wey still be di biggest grain market for West Africa , e dey bring pipo from all part of di kontinent , even from far place like Gabon and Congo .
All dis na result of di foresight wey Alhaji Bashari Garko ( may Allah bless im soul ) , wey establish di market get .
Di three administration wey don rule Kano from 1999 till today , fit claim say all of dem be di best tin wey don happun to Kano , but why Kano don reduce to numba nine for Nigeria ?
One single project no dey wey don bring correct economic change for Kano , even afta plenti effort of consign pipo .
If di elite dey focus and determine , wit state leadership as e dey for di pre - colonial period , Kano no go go down to numba nine for Nigeria wit GDP of $ 13 . 30b afta Lagos ( $ 46 . 03b ) , Rivers ( $ 32 . 14b ) , Delta ( $ 25 . 48b ) , Oyo ( $ 21 . 64b ) , Imo ( $ 20 . 64 ) , Edo ( $ 17 . 50b ) , Akwa Ibom ( $ 15 . 26 ) and Ogun ( $ 13 . 82 ) .
If we no prevent am now , we no go fit imagine di disaster wey go kom in di next 10 years .
Dis na becos of many reasons .
One of dem be say we get more dan four million pupils for public basic schools ( primary and JSS ) and by 2033 dem go don finish secondary education .
Assume say na onli 10 percent of dem ( 400 , 000 ) go go higher - level , di government go fit sponsor dia education ?
Afta dem complete higher education , di economy go fit give dem beta employment ?
As e be so , e no fit .
Dis na becos , more dan 250 medical doctors and more dan 1000 nurses wey di state government dey sponsor , na im dem no fit employ .
We go dey deceive awasef wit di skills acquisition programme wey dey train artisans wey no go get any job afta dem learn di skills , sake of say di local economy no fit employ dem .
Everi day we dey hear billions wey federal government allocate for one economic programme or di oda , and still , we no dey reason pass to train plumbers , carpenters , mechanics etc .
Since , awa idea no dey about how we go use resources employ di large population as Gajimasu ( 1095 - 1135 ) do wen e begin di city walls .
We need tink outside di box .
Kano no need genius wey get di best qualification and experience , or saint as di next governor .
Dis na becos di governors wey dey for di last 20 years get som of di best quality , and dem fit even don do dia best , but as all of us dey see , di result no be di best for di state .
So , we need reason outside di box .
Di two parties , APC and PDP no fit provide di kind leadership wey we want , sake of say na godfathers dey kontrol dem , and dem no get idea on wetin to do , but dia main focus na how to share di state resources .
Di best tin wey dem fit do na to negotiate for governor wey go serve di interest of a godfather or cabal .
So , di two parties no be di best option .
Beta pesin fit kom outside on e own , or wit di help of oda beta patriotic pipo .
E fit use any way win , even if e negotiate wit any of di two parties or anoda party sef .
E dey possible
E don happun befor .
One example wey dey near us na Nasir Elrufai for Kaduna State .
Im be one of di best for im generation , but di security situation for di state don pass im power , sake of say e dey depend on im personal intelligence and capacity .
Pesin wey beta pass am for Kano no go make di place beta unless dem change som important tins .
I no claim say I get all di answer or even say na me get all di idea wey dey down .
Som of dem na part of Aminu Kano idea .
Plenti beta idea dey for di mind of more intelligent pipo .
Di idea wey I dey suggest na base on my small experience as labourer of politicians and som trainin wey I get outside dis kontri .
Right now , Kano dey crossroad , and dis ideas fit dey useful .
Som pipo need kom togeda to organise one political movement wey no dey in kontrol of anybodi but pipo wey wan sacrifice .
Make dem look di suggestion below :
Need dey for us to start political organisation at di lowest level and make sure say na di members dey in kontrol .
Material reward no go dey , but sacrifice .
Dis dey possible wit mobilisation and di right message .
Befor di election , di movement or party need take detail inventory of di state and design comprehensive action plan wit specific targets wey dey measurable .
Operational guidelines go dey for all appointees plus di governor , and dem go need announce am so every citizen go fit know and challenge , if dem no follow am .
Anybodi wey dey find position inside di movement or party , go begin from di lowest level to di highest .
Som pipo go argue say dis strategy go kill ambition .
Wetin we need now no be ambition but sustainable system wey dey in kontrol of di pipo .
Also , make dem no give anybodi any position unless e don fulfil som basic condition of competence and honesty , and e go bring reference and guarantor .
All public officers must declare dia asset publicly , and dia family members own join , immediately dem reach office .
And forensic experts go need verify everytin .
From time to time , di public need dey know dia salary and expenses ( plus travel , entertainment etc ) .
Anybodi wey becom governor or reach any position no go ever do tins on e own .
Di governor no go ever
Make appointment alone .
Criteria , go dey , dem go need set expectation or target for dose kind appointment , and dem go need dey assess and evaluate am from time to time .
All contract wey dem go award go dey fair and transparent , and expert inside and outside di government bureaucracy must evaluate am .
Allocation of plots must dey transparent too .
No governor go get total kontrol of di treasury and na competent staff go dey in charge .
Di governor go be di leader wey go guide all di institution to develop and end one - man rule .
If di governor dey free from dis prison of power , e go lead di state to greatness .
E go lead by example and corruption go reduce becos dem don block all di way wey e fit use abuse power .
Governor suppose dey to supervise public servants and make sure say everybodi do im duty well .
E suppose inspire im pipo wit good lifestyle , commitment to service and transparency .

Arteta must deliver next season
As I don mention befor , Arsenal no get am for mind to sack Mikel Arteta and di club management go back am to turn di Gunners around next season .
Nobodi dey sure if Arsenal don take di right decision , but di club dey plan bring more talented players dis summer .
Pipo dey ask serious questions about di manager ability , and even e own dressin room players dey look am dey wonder if na im be di right man for di job .
For 39 years , Arteta get reputation , wey e build wit Pep Guardiola , as a brilliant coach .
But , afta seventeen months wey e don dey in charge , di fortune of Arsenal neva improve and plenti pipo go argue say di performance of di team dey low pass wen Unai Emery , di man wey e replace , wey knock am out of Europa League dey dia .
Arteta na captain for Arsenal befor and di fans welcome am as dia new champion .
But dem don dey lose patience and dem dey agitated as dem see sayChelsea and Tottenham done move ahead .
Di Super League disaster no be sometin wey pipo go forget for a long time
but I fit tell u say di Kroenke owners no dey go anywia .
So , e dey Arteta hand to improve tins , build strong team and get im tactics right next season , if not di proud Gunners fit crash and burn .
De Gea no go gree to be No 2
Even say Manchester United goalkeeper David De Gea get im contract till 2023 , im agent dey test microphone , to see di club wey go wan sign am .
I dey hear for inside Old Trafford say even say e get gud parole wit di current No 1 Dean Henderson , De Gea no go siddun take bench for long .
I dey hear say Atletico Madrid , Paris Saint Germain and Real Madrid get interest .
We no go deny say di 30 - year - old dey on top of im career , even say som pipo for inside di club believe say e don drop small for di past two years .
Manager Solskjaer tok say , Goalkeeper departments dey veri tight knit group .
Dem dey work for preparation , dem get different gym session , personal session to di rest of di squad and dem dey stay togeda more .
Naturally dem dey create a bond and di spirit for di goalkeepin department dey high .
Na beta competition .
I am sure the coach is right however if De Gea doesnt regain recognition for the No1 stitched onto the back of his shirt and is left on the bench in crucial games , I am reliably informed he will move out of Old Trafford .
I take West Brom to bounce back yet again
After one season back in the Premier League we again say goodbye to West Bromwich Albion .
The key to yet another quick bounce back from the Championship will be whether or not fire - fighting manager Sam Allardyce can be persuaded to stay .
He is disappointed to have lost his reputation as never having been relegated with any club and the board at West Brom have a lot of work to do if they want to keep him .
Ainsley Maitland - Niles , Conor Gallagher and Okay Yokuslu will return to their parent clubs after being on loan but Matheus Pereira , Callum Robinson , Hal Robson - Kanu and Karlan Grant can impress in the lower league .
Who is the fastest player in the Manchester City squad ?
No , it isnt Raheem Sterling .
Manager Pep Guardiola set up a practice whereby each player had to control the ball and sprint 10 yards .
There are some very fast movers in the City squad but Gabriel Jesus proved he was the fastest .
The best is yet to come from Havertz
Thomas Tuchel has been singing the praises of Kai Havertz and pointed to his two goals recently scored against Fulham .
Tuchel recognises that since Kai arrived at Stamford Bridge from Bayer Leverkusen , things have not gone well for the German .
Moving from a foreign country and having to handle lockdown restrictions made things difficult and of course he caught Covid - 19 and had to battle back to fitness .
If they do not win their next game , Sheffield United will become the first team since the 1904 - 05 season to have gone without winning two consecutive games .
Kane is keen to move on from his boyhood club after Tottenham also missed out on the Champions League for a second straight year .
Chairman for di economic and financial crimes commission ( EFCC ) Abdulrasheed Bawa don make declaration say dem go resuscitate di Bank Employees Assets Declaration Act of 1986 to block loopholes wey bankers don create to sanitise di kontri's financial system
According to wetin Bawa tok , dem take di decision due to di role wey dem dey expect make bankers play for di fight against corruption , as di EFCC don mandate am to ensure say dem comply wit di Act .
Section 1 for di Bank Employees Declaration of Assets Act 1986 don make am mandatory for Evri employee for di bank to make full disclosure of assets upon employment for annual basis .
Di law wey dey under Section 7 Sub - Section 1 stipulates say na offence e go be for an employee of a bank make e own assets in excess of dia legitimate and probable income
Afta di EFCC chairman don stipulate di deadline , consequences go arise as a result of non - declaration by bank employees
Spelt out penealty of 10 years inprisonment upon conviction as well as forfeiture of assets wey dey beyond and above legitimate income and probable earnings for dat kain bank employees .
Dis piece of legislature don dey so tey 1986 under di military
So tey , dis part of di constitution don dey ineeffective by those wey suppose dey implement am ordinarily
Bankers don aware of dis legislation but di level wey dem dey comply no dey encouraging
For di 80s , dem dey hand form to bankers wey dem go complete and submit
But as e dey go for awa kontri , dem don abandon di implementation of dat provision for di law , and dem no longer consideram as a fundamental part for di banking profession .
Stakeholders dey blame di failure on top di authorities wey include di CBN , Chartered Institute of Bank of Naija ( CIBN ) and Bankers Committee for some kain abnormalities wey dey di industry .
According to wetin dem dey tok , dem say diz regulators dey rely on di bank wey dem suppose supervise , make e supply information
For instance , dem don argue am say di failed banks episode apun some months afta dem give di regulator for diz banks clean bill of health
Dis suggest say dem don doctor di information wey di bank supplied
Naija don dey battle case like corruption and money laundering and dem dey accuse bankers and banking officials say dem be part of it
Some moni don remain redundant for plenti accounts bikos some account owners don kpeme which some bank officials go convert to dia own as dem go leave families of di account owners for penury .
Dis dey in spite of di fact say di banking sector no strange to self - regulation , given its tempting , delicate and di operating system wey dey fragile
Di CIBN Act of 2007 don dey regulate di banking system
E get code of conduct wey bankers don agree pon wit CBN
Disciplinary tribunal wey get power for di high court dey and e dey ensure say dem bring reported infractions , unethical conduct and indiscipline before di tribunal , and sanctions wey dem recommended for formal prosecution .
But one of di challenges be di weak reporting system wey bankers get wey dey lead to di inability of CIBN make dem take appropriate actions .
Di spirit wey stan gidigba for di back of di Act of 1986 na to make clear , di financial standing wey bank employee get for di time of employment , and afta years of service , in a bid wey go make dem ascertain say dem dey commensurate dia legitimate earnings wit dia lifestyles wey dey current
Na dis dey kom on top di heels of allegation say some bankers be direct beneficiaries for fraudulent transactions wey dem dey carry out for di bank
Wetin be common knowledge be say di declaration of assests by public officers wey include di civil servants , pesin wey dey politically exposed and those wey dey for di Ministries , Departments and Agencies ( MDAs ) .
Dem require dem make dem declare dia assets evri four years
On top di election and appointment of political office holders , before dem assume office dem suppose declare di assets wey dey get pon entry kom declare am again for di exit point
Dem do dis declaration by oath
For anoda word , execution and attestation before di high court or some oda superior officer for di law dey
Di Naija customs service ( NCS ) , Naija Immigration Service ( NIS ) , among odas , dem don covered by di Code of Conduct Act wit regard to di declaration of dia assets .
As e dey so finacial experts believe say di impression wey di directive to bankers create make dem comply wit di of legislation wey dey pre - exist dey amount to stigmatisation and e dey also isolates bank employees , wey dey puts dem in di limelight .
In oda words , d belief of revisiting of di Act of 1986 dey encourage di policy of isolation wey dey kos apprehension in di industry .
Dis na di concern say di Act fit kos enrolment into di banking profession to further go down as a result of stigmatisation .
Some stakeholders don caution against di drama about stigmatisation , arguing say plenti bankers , from di highest cadre to di level wey low pass , dey live above dia means .
According to wetin dem tok , an average banker even from dia early point of calling , dey cut corners by conniving wit customers say dem go beat di system .
Dem insist say for evri major corruption , banker wey dey facilitate di transaction dey
E dey laudible say di EFCC dey try use di Act for reason wey good
Di worry be say di banks wey di goment no own per se although di goverment get shares in dem
Dem dey use bank save moni
Di koko be say laws wey dey check illicit enrichment dey
Article 20 for di UN Convention Against Corruption dey explicit on top dis
Section 7 for di EFCC act don empower EFCC make e dey investigate pesin wey hin lifestyle no commensurate wit di means of income wey dem get
Dem believe am for some part say di politically exposed person dey plunder di assests for dis kontri plenti of dem dey untouchable
Dem accuse EFCC say e no fair and even - handed
If dem sanitise di banking sector , we go get ripple effect for oda sectors of di economy
Dem take all diz measure to strengden di fight against corruption , and not to stigmatise di banking profession or portray it as di scapegoat wey dey witin di system .
Besides , di banking career no be one kain rouguish profession
Some bankers be di forefront of exposing some of di mega corruption issues wey wedon see di EFCC making headway .
Part of why dis law dey be say e dey ensure make di kontri dey free from financial crimes , and make e dey also block loopholes wey unscrupulous players dey esploit
While dem dey hope say make di Act of 1986 na sincere attempt at sanitising di system , dem suppose create platform wey go report thresholds of deposits on a daily basis , and di regulator suppose dey able to access it to know di declarations wey dem make .
E dey make am easy reference to wetin dem don declare as legitimate income to check those wey dey live above dia means

Farmers don raise concern as CBN don suspend anchor Borrowers loans
Farmers and oda stakeholders for di agricultural sector dey express dia concern over di suspension of agricultural loans wey dem dey access through di Naija Incentive - Based Risk Sharing System for Agricultural Lending ( NIRSAL ) by di Central Bank of Naija ( CBN ) recently
I dey think say una dey run / jappa for me
E dey handle most of di agric loans to di farmers by di CBN especially its popular Anchor Borrower Programme ( ABP ) .
Di apex bank say di fraudulent activities for NIRSAL loans under di ABP and dem order for di suspension of such loans until dem don pay all previous beneficiaries back .
E no dey clear yet if di suspension dey only on di Anchor Borrowers Programme alone or e also include those of Micro finance banks through NIRSAL .
Di suspension don ground loan activities fror NIRSAL and farmers dey worried say among odas , di timing dey wrong , as many of dem don go far wit plans say dem go expand dia agricultural production
One farmer wey dey really worried say wetin dey apun now dey threaten di economy and e dey call on top di CBN make dem please step in and save millions of Naija pipo make dem access diS loans for agricultural production .
Plenti farmers wey dey wait for NIRSAL disbursement for di social media handle don express sadness over di suspension of di loan facility as e dey threaten to ground dia dreams for expansion .
As hin dey react to di development for di chat wit awa Agric Editor , di leadership of all di farmers association of Naija , wey Architect Kabiru Ibrahin dey head am , tok say thoughdi CBN dey blames NIRSAL for di non - performance of di ABP , make dem do di needful in fishing out those wey dey responsible .
Make e dey kontinu to provide qualified farmers di support wey dem need
We dey urge di CBN make dem do due dilligence in prequalifying farmers wey dey participate for di programme bikos several cases of briefcase farmers wey dey pose as real farmers abound .
Dem collude wit some NIRSAL officials make dem defraud di programme
Timely repayment no dey forthkoming for di ABP bikos of di fraud
Anyone wey give bribe to take a loan wit an interest component no get desire to repay am
awa initial understanding of di role of di NIRSAL na to primarily incentivize commercial banks make dem embrace lending for agricultural production but certainly no be to prequalify prospective loan seeking companies .
dis na how corruption take take over and di farmers now be di worst for it
Hin say we dey call on top di CBN make e reverse di decision on top di disbursement of di ABP support to farmers
Dr Femi Oke wey be di AFAN chairman for South - west zone say di suspension of di NIRSAL loans go impact food production for di kontri greatly
As Oke dey follow di News Agency of Naija ( NAN ) for Lagos don urge di CBN make dem investigate di allegations wey dey against NIRSAL witout undermining di various efforts wey farmers get toward achieving food security and self - sufficiency .
Hin call on top di CBN make dem resolve di issues wey dey surround di suspension of di NIRSAL loans
Di AFAN official say dem disappointed plenti farmers by di suspension of di Anchor Borrowers Programme ( ABP ) and NIRSAL loans , as dem dey provide a lot of support to smallholder farmers .
NAN also reported say di CBN recently suspend all loans wey di NIRSAL disburse following di allegation of corruption by its officials
Wetin dey una mind
Di memo say dem go only reverse di decision afta dem pay all outstanding loan wey farmers neva pay back
According to wetin Oke yarn wen we hear about di suspension of di NIRSAL loans , we don know immediately say dis no good for di farmers and di sector .
for wetin we hear , dem base di suspension for di ABP
We want make CBN lay more emphasis on how dem go go about am bikos some of di farmers don go do interview on NIRSAL loans , while odas dey await di disbursement of di funds .
wetin go be dia fate now ?
hin say , e no good and we dey implore make goverment chook mouth for di mata and address am
Oke don urge di goverment make di federal goverment intervene , in order make e no jeopardise di efforts wey farmers wey don invest for hin farm , and those wey dey wait for di loans wey go make dem plant dis season
Dem need do something immediately make e no go jeopardise di effort of di farmers say dem ready to go back to di farm
Plenti farmers specifically in di South - West dey wait on top di loan and dem dey expect say by now dem suppose disburse am
Very few of awa members don get access to di loan , plenti neva get access to di interview
me self neva do di interview
I still dey wait make dem select me
hin stressed am say , farmers no dey hapi on top di suspension of loan
Di AFAN chairman don tok am for di NIRSAL selection process say e dey slow bikos of di COVID - 19 pandemic such dat na only about 10 per cent of awa farmers don benefit for di loan .
Hin say we want make di federal goverment clarify if di suspension go dey on di CBN Anchor Borrowers Programme alone and on di Microfinance bank through NIRSAL
Immediate reaction from di NIRSAL no dey ova di suspension of di loans as an official , wey crave make e dey anonymous , tok say na only di CBN fit tok on top di mata and e don tok .
Sources for di apex bank tok say di suspension dey to ensure efficiency for di system and assure farmers for di bank's commitment to guarantee food security

Hunger , poverty and di challenge for innovative food storage
Gimme evrithin wey una get
If una visit plenti offices across di kontri for lunchtime during di months of may , june , july and August , chances dey high say una go find a good number of workers wey dey munch am for mouth .
True as corn don dey season one of di delicacies for dis time na di combination of roasted corn ( wey dem popularly code - name as mouth organ ) and di pear for Africa pear .
Coconut na ocassional substitute wey dey close to pear dis writer get good authority ova am say plenti pipo dey find di coconut and a mouth - organ combination say e delicious
Outside dis months wey corn and pear dey season di combination no dey dey available
During di harvest months enough corn and pear wey go sustain di kontri for a substantial period , perhaps na an entire year , dem go don harvest am
But wit inadequate knowledge and how dem go utilize modern and cost - effective storage and preservation methods , tonnes of maize and pear just dey waste Evri year .
Di same dey apply to oda agricultural commodities for Naija
For harvest periods , surplus dey often dey , but in di absence of proper storage , a huge proportion of dis harvest dey waste .
Dis perennial issues don pose one huge threat to di economic well - being of farmers , di major wey dey operate for di subsistence level .
Di challenge wey be di kwanta of poor storge and preservation of food dey pose to awa kontri , don bekom more haunting wen pesin dey consider di difficulties wey confront us for di post - COVID era
E dey imperative say beyond di volume of awa agricultural output wey dey improve make we look critically at how we go empower farmers across di kontri manage dia harvests beta
Na dis go translate to immense economic value not only to di farmers demselves wey go enhance dia livelihoods , but also to di kontri as a whole , as plenti food go dey available for extended periods , for consumption and export
Plenti research organisations and universities don introduce different solutions to di kwanta of post - harvest losses as di years dey pass
Di innovations wey dem don develop , being home - grown dey unique bikos dem dey reflect di reality of awa local goverment
No be say dem dey relatively cheap , as dem dey often dey technically uncomplicated , but farmers fit adopt dem readily
For di area of fish farming , one innovation dey wey dem dey call am iced - fish box wey dem go use harvest fish go store am so e go remain fresh on transportation to di market from di farm or ahead of processing and storage .
Dem don develop special smoking kilns wey go replace di labour - intensive , traditional fish smoking methods wey no dey efficient and e dey unhealthy
Outputs wey dey commot for dis kilns be good enough for export and e dey several multiples of wetin dem dey ordinarily obtain for traditional fish - smoking methods .
Naija researchers don also produce composite packaging material wey dem fit use package dat kain smoked fish or even smoked meat as di case fit be , preserving di end - product and e dey boost di commercial appeal
If to say na beans , corn or rice wey don discoloured , mouldy , smelly or e dey infected wit weevils , grains dey pose gbege of storage for farmers and e dey lead to considerable financial losses
For di past , grains wey dem dey export from Naija don face rejection bikos of di unacceptable level of residual pesticides wey dem contain
Local researchers wey dey active for di area of grain preservation , churning out of a handful of innovative solutions ova di years
For instance , solar dryers wey dem develop for different products dey
If to say di abundance of sunshine wey dey awa kontri and di simplicity of construction of dis dryers , dem dey available for average farmers
Dem fit replicate construction easily for di local setin
Dis solar dryers work dey enhance di efficiency of drying of agricultural produce
Dem dey do dis as dem dey concentrate di rays of di sun on a particular surface , wey go dey enhance drying efficiency over di traditional method wey dem dey take use spread grains , cassava , plantain peeling and odas indiscriminately under di sun
local researchers don develop specially constructed steel drums wey wen dem shut am bikom airtight ( hermit ) and e dey allow make farmers store grains ova several months
Dem be specialised storage silos wey fit help store and preserve grains over plenti months
In fact one twin silo dey , wey fit accommodate 100 tonnes of grains at a time
Local researchers don also develop bio - pesticide as an alternative to chemical pesticides
Chemical pesticides wey dey available though effective against pest dey harmful to man and hin environment , too
Bio - pesticide for di oda hand , dey much safer and dem dey constitute no hazard for environment
Dem make One of such pesticide ( NSPRIDUST ) wey be an innovation by di Naija stored product research institute , from diatomaceous earth , wey be a powdery form wey dey occure for rock naturally for Naija
Bio - pesticides go help make Naija grains potentially dey more acceptable for di export market
We no fit leave fruit and vegetable out of di problem of poor preservation and storage for Naija
As we dey import apple , pears , strawberries and oda fruits round - di - clock plenti no dey wey we go yarn on top Naija's fruit exports
Again , over time Naija researchers don herald different solutions to dis yawa wey dey ground
One shed wey dem construct specially for fruit and vegetable for instance , wey dem make of simple and raw materials wey be local ones , and e dey help farmers preserve fruits and vegegtables for long
Den , di fruit dryer , wey dey dry certain fruits dey help to preserve dem
Local researcher dey work fervently on top fruits and vegetable conservation using di principle of evaporative cooling
Evaporative cooling na di cooling wey dey result make water evaporate from a surface

Alhaji Aminu Hussain , wey dey sorghum , say to dey keepkeep market no be new tin for di market , but e kom go up wit di new agricultural policy of dis administration and border wey dem close .
Many of us chop beta gain ontop farm produce for last year , na why pipo kom out quick dis harvest time to dey buy keep but border wey dem open don slow am down .
The fear wey we get na say price for food go still kom down .
E add join say farm produces wey no kom out plenti bikos of bad way of dem bandit dis year , don give market pipo mind to keepkeep dia market .
Rice , maize and sorghum n aim dem put eye .
Mallam Muhammadu Tarzana , wey dey sell grain for Bakori market , say as dem shout to open border again last week don get hand ontop price for major food for di market .
E no be like last year we , by dis time , maize dey around N8 , 000 and N9 , 500 , sorghum dey N7 , 000 , nah N14 , 000 and N13 , 000 dem dey sell dem now .
Dis shout of open border again wey dem shout down spoil di price of paddy rice from N14 , 000 go N12 , 000 , sorghum from N14 , 500 go N13 , 000 and maize from N15 , 500 go N14 , 000 .
Tarzana add join say many market pipo comot hand to dey buy market bigbig afta dem shout am , get am for mind say di breeze from importation of food go enta anytime .

Sani Muazu Hunkuyi , wey be one agric expert , beg di goment make dem sumit give di pressure , allow food to dey enter .
Goment don invest plenti agric sector and make we nor allow dat big investment enta water wit breeze of importation inside dis kontri
Na true say fear for food crisis don burst evriwia , but we fit reduce am wit farming wit water .
To dey import food go make dis economic recession wey dey di kontri worst to tackle , na im Muazu tok
E add join say yawa go gas for farmers dem if goment cancel dia policy ontop to make food plenti .
Why rice wey flood nor dey important to farmers dem .
Di threat ontop food for Nigeria bikos of flood go soon be tin of di past as dem release FARO 66 , one type of rice wey flood no fit kari .
FARO 66 , wey National Cereal Research Institute ( NCRI ) release give farming pipo dem be type wey get some tins wey dey different from wetin farmers for here sabi before .
Dis type tall pass other one wey farmers sabi .
Witi how im tall and some betabeta farming mata , e get power to survive palava of flood wella .
To kolet new tins among farmers dem dey always be big problem and as dem introduce FARO66 no dey different .
But if dem farmer kolet am finish , di threat ontop food about rice mata go reduce .
For dis year field trip wey NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi , capital of Kebbi State organise , farmers and dem oga dey introduced to dis new type afta a field trip wey dem do for di institute demonstration farm for di city .
For di demonstration farm , farmers dey expose to FARO66 , wey stand gidigba wit flood inside farm and other rice follow di same flood waka .
Di two farm wey dey near each oda show di power to tanda wit flood wey FARO66 type get , wit all di wahala , e grow and strong .
One di farm of other type of rice , na di remaining of rice wey die remain dem see .
As im follow awa news pipo talk , di oga for di NCRI station for Birnin Kebbi , Andrew Shema , say di FARO 66 go tanda wit flood if dem quick plant am .
E add join say , im stem wey hard and as e tall , if dem part am quick , di type go don grow reach size wey be say if flood com , di plant nor go gree for am .
He tok say FARO66 dey release two years ago but to kolet , as for di case wit any new tin , must be small small , tok say , if farmers dem don accept am wella , flood nor go be threat to rice farming again .
As im take tok , to open di eyes of farmers dem as research ontop dis new type dey go front , dem carry dem join bodi to see how e dey go and to record result .
E add join say science pipo wey dey ontop di research get sense say if dem allow farmers dem to see how dis plant fit take tanda wit flood , no be only to accept am go dey fast , to dey use sef go dey .
Shema wey tok say as dem nor give dem plenti moni be dia major wahala for di research work , e call stakeholders dem to kom invest ontop dia idea for beta tomorrow as di research no go only develop di new type but e go still create job , and still develop economy for di kontri .
E explain say dem still do public lecture wey dey among program wey dem do for di first day of di field day wey dem do , e say why dem introduce public lecture join dis year program na to show stakeholders dem say nah if moni wey reach dey n aim research fit get head .
E beg pipo wey get mouth for Nigeria and organization to kom drop put for research .
Di two days nah ontop to show how technology take enter farming
Wen we tok say he dey tanda wit flood , we no tok say flood no go affect am patapata .
Wetin we dey tok be say wit all di tin wey e get for bodi , e go tanda wit flood wahala reach one side .
FARO 66 go tanda wit flood wahala bikos e tall pass FARO 44 and FARO 52 .
Im stem still hard pass other one .
To manage sky as in to plant quickquick na im be di key to tanda wit flood .
To plant quickquick dey save bigbig if flood come .
If rain don starts , farmers dem no need to dey waste time .
Dis one go make crop dey strong and hold leg for ground wella before flood go com , as im tok .

Governance wey dey poor and illegal weapon for wey dey spread by Adefolarin A . Olamilekan
Governance for Nigeria in dis new time especially since di time wey Civil rule don return in 1999 don dey make pipo dey put eye for am .
Di eye wey dem put na bad tori of di goment wey no gree tackle security mata for di country .
E get one sence wey wetin dey hapun make to take sabi governance wella , especially wit plenti plenti illegal weapon dem evriwia for Nigeria .
Di nation no dey good at all , but dey concern for di safety of im pipo .
Pipo dey cry for help for beta security of life and dere properties
As im be today , di way wey weapon dem wey dey illegal dey plenti evri wia na serious wahala for economic sustenance , unity and to dey togeda .
Na inside all dis kasala wey we take sabi wetin di link wey dey between governance and di illegal weapon wey dey evriwia be , wey be main mata for dis time of awa national life .
As Nigeria dey go up and down for di last two decades don make plenti Nigerians sabi wetin be di poverty governance .
As e take be like dat , e go beta for us make we sabi wetin governance be for simple sense and wetin in be for inside dis context .
Di Oxford Advanced Learners Dictionary , Sixth Edition tok say governance na di way wey dem dey control one kontri or di way wey one kontri or institution deu dey control .
So , governance na di process of control and controlling activity wey dey a kontri join weapon wit im circulation .
Again , governance still fit dey look as di process wey dem goment pipo dey hold power , authority and di way wey dem dey give policy wey pertain to pesin life and economic decision for di beta beta of di pipo .
As e be , to dey run di goment go take make dem use decision wey dey good and wey go get good impact on top di management and di sharing of resources wey include moni , pesin and material .
E go involve di regulation , implementation and enforcement for d policy wey pesin want , wey go be for objective wey get target , goals and aspiration through capacity .
As e be , governance na to dey control di development wey pesin want , wey be say , to protect life and property of kontri pipo tru d regulate of arms and weapon dem be koko .
As e be so , e get plenty reason wey explain di poverty wey never stop since for governance for Nigeria .
For example , poor institutional capacity na im cause goment failure , wey no make everything balance in di wey dem dey do justice and fairness , wey cause oppression and jagajaga for mind .
To add join dis one , na as dem dey do ojoro dey help dere family dem , as dem dey selfish , ethnic partial wey don cut to dey togeda ontop decision making troway , and as di political representative no dey too do dia work .
Di mata wey di Chairman for di National peace Committee ( NPC ) and d former Military Head of State , General Abdulsallami Abubakar tok for Transcorp Hilton for Abuja say e pass 6 million illegal weapon wey dem fit trace to di kontri pipo , many of dem no get work and dem dey hungry and angry .
Di nomba of di small small weapon wey dey Nigeria for di hand of kontri pipo wey no dey military reach 6 , 145 , 000 and armed forces and law enforcement pipo count dia own to be 586 , 000 weapon .
E still tok go front about di sekuriti problem wey dey di kontri .
E tell all di nation say na 80 , 000 Nigeria pipo don die for recent month and like three million pipo be Internally Displaced Persons ( IDPs ) evriwia for di kontri bikos say sekuriti problem dey plenti and illegal weapon dem waka evriwia for di country .
E kon tok say di sekuriti forces no just dey over work but dem no get moni , and e tok say dem fit do beta if dem give dem beta weapon , equipment and make dem give dem moni wey go dey accountable .
As di forma head of state and di chairman for National Peace Committee ( NPC ) take shuk mouth for di mata , e don show say we suppose take governance serious ontop plenty die - die tins for di kontri .
Wela , e don show say pipo wey even dey power and authority dey live for inside fear .
For dis side dem suppose hear cry for help of d pipo make dem try reduce as illegal weapon dem waka evriwia .
For onetime dem tok say na for Africa weapon dey increase pass .
Small arms , Mass Atrocities & Migration for Nigeria , tok say na as weapon too dey increase na im make bring gunpipo , n aim still kos di scatascata of many Nigeria pipo .
Di report tok say na as weapon dey plenti for Southern Nigeria n aim make kasala plenti for area like village wahala , cult , kidnapping , tribe and religion gbege , and militancy for di Niger Delta .
And na d same way di report tok say for Northern Nigeria side , as per say corruption don plenti for dat side , dem get plenti land wey no get pesin wey dey rule am , and dem no too get work and na dis tins don make criminal and wahala mani for dia side .
Di report tok say wetin we tok before hapun bikos say Small Arms and Light Weapons ( SALW ) dey increase .
Di mata dey question di feasibility of di National Task Force on top Small Arms and Light Weapons .
So , we must to find di way to dey go front , even say e no dey clear and we no fit settle am .
We suppose face di mata and tackle as di illegal weapon dey dey evriwia for di kontri wit all di goment structure wey dey tackle di mata for di federal , state and local goment level .
And as e be , di National Task Force for Small Arms and Light weapons and di office of di National Sekuriti Adviser for di President ( ONSA ) must tight moremore to tackle di illegal arm wey don plenty wit to disturb and to stop am .
As e kon be like dis , we need program wey go teach how dem dey carry pipo for mind for governance and di sekuriti policy dey needed no be only community policing but policing for individual and group to dey share intelligence .
Di main tin na transparency , accountability and responsibility for beta governance , if dem dey , we no go fit comot all di illegal weapon wet dey evriwia .
