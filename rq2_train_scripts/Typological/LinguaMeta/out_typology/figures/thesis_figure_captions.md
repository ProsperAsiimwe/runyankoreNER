# Thesis Figure Captions (starter)
- Fig. 1 — Typology similarity ranking (equal weights). Bars show S_total for each auxiliary language relative to Runyankore.
- Fig. 2 — Feature heatmap (equal weights). Rows are auxiliaries; columns are six typology features used to compute S_total.
- Fig. 3 — S_total vs F1 (per variant). Correlation between typology similarity and downstream NER F1 (co-train / zero-shot × model).
- Fig. 4 — Learned feature weights (per variant). Data-driven weights that best align similarity with observed F1s.
- Fig. 5/6 — PCA view of groups. 2D projection of the six-dimensional feature space with cluster labels.
- Fig. 7 — Cluster sizes. Number of auxiliaries assigned to each typology cluster (equal or learned-weights).
